    "body": "Assigning a Point of Sale\nA point of sale (POS) on TripActions creates a localized traveler experience by providing pricing in the traveler's local currency, access to locally published fares, and region-specific corporate rates. Company admins can select the POS that best meets the needs of their travelers directly through the TripActions platform. There are two ways to set a traveler's POS: \n\nOffice-based assignment: Admins can assign a POS to their office locations; when travelers are assigned to an office location, they will automatically adopt the POS for that office. For example, if the company's London office is assigned to the UK POS, all travelers assigned to the London office will be on the UK POS. \nIndividual user assignment: Admins can assign a POS to individual users that will override their office-based POS. For example, a user who is assigned to an office in the United States and travels frequently to the United Kingdom can be individually assigned to the UK POS. \nNote: Only the points of sale enabled for your company will be available for use. To add a POS, an in-country physical address, company registration number, and tax ID number will be required. If your company has a designated Customer Success Manager you can contact them directly to request a new POS. Otherwise, please submit a request through the TripActions Community. \n \n\nConfiguring an office-based assignment\nOffice-based point of sale assignments are set within each individual office location. To change an office location's POS, follow the steps listed below.\n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Company | Configuration > Organization\nChoose the Offices tab from the left panel and select Edit to add to an existing location or + Add office to create a new location\nNavigate to the Assign a point of sale country dropdown menu and select the country that is enabled for that location. This may not be the exact county where the office is located; for example, if your office is located in Belgium, you will have been enabled for the Netherlands POS. The dropdown menu will only display the points of sale that have been enabled for your company. For a full list of points of sale available on TripActions, view this article. \n\nImportant note: Existing TripActions customers with office locations already created will not automatically be assigned a point of sale; company admins must edit the office location's information to add an office-based POS. When an office-based point of sale is added, each user assigned to that location will be moved to its point of sale. Any subsequent office-based POS changes will not change the point of sale of existing users assigned to the location. See the next section, Individual User Assignment, for instructions on how to change a user's point of sale. \n\nimage.png\n \nViewing and configuring an individual user assignment\nEach user's POS is reflected in the Agency column of your TripActions user list and can be modified through a manual file upload. TripActions uses a special coding system to indicate each POS, therefore, we recommend contacting your Customer Success Manager for information about what each code represents prior to making any changes. If you do not have a designated Customer Success Manager, use this link to request assistance.\n \n\nFrequently asked questions\nQ: If a user is not assigned to an office, will they have a POS assignment? \nA: If the user has not been assigned an office location, they will be added to the office indicated as the Default by company admins. For example, if the New York office is the company's set default, any user without an office assigned or an individual user POS will be added to the New York office and its POS. \n\nQ: What happens if a user's POS is blank on the user list (the Agency column)?\nA: If a user's Agency column is left blank, they will automatically be added to their office location's assigned POS. For example, if a user without a POS assignment is assigned to the Amsterdam office, they will be added to the POS assigned to the Amsterdam office. \n\nQ: How do POS assignments work with an HRIS integration?\nA: HRIS syncs will not change the information entered into the Agency column; information in the Agency column will remain in place unless changed manually by an admin or through an office-based assignment change. \n\nQ: What point of sale is a new user assigned to?\nA: If a new user is created without an office assignment (i.e. a user is invited through the Invite users button), they will automatically be assigned to the office location indicated as the default and therefore that office location's POS.\n\nQ: What happens if I change a user's office assignment? Will their POS assignment automatically change? \nA: If a user’s office location is updated, their POS will be changed to match the office location's point of sale. However, if the user had an individual user assignment already in place, it will override the office-based assignment and the user's POS will not be changed. \n\n",

Merging will disable one account and transfer all earned TripActions Rewards and booking data (including upcoming trips) into one single account.\nMoving an account: Moving an account is recommended if you want to associate an existing TripActions account with a different company's account (i.e. you are registered with a personal email and want to use the same email on a corporate account). The traveler will retain access to their booking history, however, the new company will not be able to access that information in their booking reports. All past trips will remain with the traveler and the old company (the account that the email is being moved from).\nTip for company admins: If you have invited a new user to your company through the Invite users feature and they are not appearing on your company user list, it may be that the user's email address is already registered with TripActions.

As rewards are company paid, they cannot be moved to a different company's account.\n \nTransferring accounts with unused tickets \nCheck the Airline credits section of your Profile page for a list of all expired and current credits.

    "body": "Reisegebühren verstehen und verwalten\nReisegebühren sind Gebühren, die pro Reiseplan berechnet werden und mehrere Buchungen umfassen können, die mit einer Reise verbunden sind. Eine Reise wird durch die Buchung eines Hotels, eines Fluges, eines Mietwagens oder eines Bahntickets erstellt, wobei je nach Bedarf weitere Buchungen hinzugefügt werden können. Für jede in TripActions neu angelegte Reise wird eine Reisegebühr erhoben, die auf der Rechnung der ersten Buchung ausgewiesen wird.\n\nIn den Reisegebühren sind enthalten:\n\nZugang zur TripActions-Plattform\nLokalisierter, unbegrenzter Live-Support jeden Tag und rund um die Uhr von TripActions Travel Experience Team\nEine einheitliche Ansicht der unternehmensweiten Reisedaten für Programmadministratoren\n \nÜberhöhte Reisegebühren vermeiden\nDamit keine überhöhten Reisegebühren entstehen, sollten Reisende alle für ihre Reise erforderlichen Transport- und Unterkunftsbuchungen in einer einzigen Reise zusammenfassen. Wenn Sie beispielsweise Kunden in Berlin und München besuchen, kann Ihre Reise in TripActions einen Hin- und Rückflug, Ihren Hotelaufenthalt in beiden Städten und ein Zugticket zwischen den Städten enthalten.\n\nBuchungen zu einer bestehenden Reise hinzufügen:\n\nRufen Sie in Ihrem Konto den Bereich Reisen auf und sehen Sie sich Ihre Bevorstehenden Reisen an.\nKlicken Sie auf eine Reise und wählen Sie + Zur Reise hinzufügen aus dem Abschnitt Reiseplan.\nDanach werden Sie zur Suchseite weitergeleitet, um die zusätzliche Buchung vorzunehmen. Dabei wird nur eine Gebühr für Ihre Reise berechnet.\n \nSollten Sie außerdem zwei oder mehr Buchungen unter einer einzigen Reise zusammenfassen wollen, können Sie dies im Abschnitt Reisen Ihres Kontos tun, indem Sie die Funktion Reisen zusammenfassen nutzen. Mit dieser Funktion können Sie alle Buchungen, die sich auf dieselbe Reise beziehen, in einem chronologisch geordneten Reiseplan zusammenfassen. Einladungen zu Veranstaltungen, wie z. B. Buchungen über die Funktion Teamreisen, können nicht mit anderen Reisen zusammengelegt werden. Hinweis: Durch die Zusammenlegung von Reisen werden nicht automatisch mehrere Reisegebühren zu einer einzigen Gebühr zusammengefasst. Um herauszufinden, ob eine oder mehrere Ihrer Gebühren erlassen werden können, wenden Sie sich bitte von Ihrem Desktop oder Ihrer mobilen App aus per Chat an das Travel Experience Team.\n\nReisen zusammenfassen:\n\nIn Ihrem Konto unter Reisen sehen Sie Ihre Bevorstehenden Reisen\nWählen Sie Reisen zusammenfassen\nNeben den Reisen, die zusammengefasst werden können, werden Kontrollkästchen angezeigt. Wählen Sie die Reisen aus, die Sie zusammenfassen möchten, und bestätigen Sie den Vorgang, indem Sie unten auf dem Bildschirm auf Zusammenfassen klicken.\n \nGebühren für Zugreisen\nWenn Sie eine Reise für eine reine Zugbuchung innerhalb Europas erstellen (die Reise beinhaltet keine Flug-, Hotel- oder Mietwagenbuchung), wird Ihnen eine reduzierte Reisegebühr in Höhe von 5 € berechnet (die Währung richtet sich nach dem Verkaufsort des Reisenden), anstatt der üblichen Reisegebühr Ihres Unternehmens. Hinweis: Die Gebühren für reine Zugreisen gelten nur für europäische Zugverbindungen.\n\nZu einer bestehenden Zugreise etwas hinzufügen:\n\nWenn Sie eine reine Zugreise erstellen und später einen Flug, ein Hotel oder ein Auto hinzufügen, wird auf der Checkout-Seite die Differenz zwischen der üblichen Reisegebühr Ihres Unternehmens und der Gebühr für die Zugreise, die zuvor berechnet wurde, angezeigt. Wenn die Standard-Reisegebühr Ihres Unternehmens beispielsweise 20 € beträgt, wird für die zusätzliche Buchung eine anteilige Reisegebühr von 15 € berechnet.\nWenn Sie eine reine Zugreise erstellen und später beschließen, eine zusätzliche Zugfahrkarte innerhalb Europas hinzuzufügen, wird Ihnen keine zusätzliche Reisegebühr berechnet.\n\nWICHTIGER HINWEIS: Alle Reisegebühren sind nicht erstattungsfähige Gebühren, die für die Nutzung der TripActions Plattform erhoben werden und auch im Falle einer Reisestornierung nicht erstattet werden können.",

    "body": "Bewährte Verfahren für die Festlegung von Richtlinien für Hotelbuchungen\nBei der Festlegung von Hotel-Richtlinien unterstützen wir Sie dabei, den Wunsch nach Kostenkontrolle und Transparenz mit einem guten Buchungs- und Reiseerlebnis für die Mitarbeitenden in Einklang zu bringen. In diesem Beitrag erfahren Sie, wie Sie eine Hotelrichtlinie in TripActions einrichten und wie Sie Ihre Einstellungen am besten wählen. Um Einblicke in die Buchungsgewohnheiten und Ausgaben Ihres Unternehmens zu erhalten, empfehlen wir den Verwaltern, die Daten aus dem Analyse-Dashboard zu nutzen. Lesen Sie weiter, um mehr über die bewährte Verfahren für die Festlegung Ihrer Richtlinien zu erfahren.\n \nEine ausführliche Anleitung zur Konfiguration und Zuweisung von Richtlinien im TripActions-Konto Ihres Unternehmens finden Sie in diesem Beitrag.\n\nimage.png\n \nKosten\nMit einer dynamischen Richtlinie können Sie am besten sicherstellen, dass Ihre Reisenden je nach Reisedatum und -ort ein preisgünstiges Hotelzimmer buchen. Bei der dynamischen Preisgestaltung werden alle sinnvollen Ergebnisse ausgewertet und ein Price to Beat (fairer Marktpreis) für die Suche berechnet.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nUm einen besseren Überblick über die Ausgaben der Reisenden zu erhalten und die Kostenkontrolle zu verbessern, können Sie mithilfe der dynamischen Richtlinie eine prozentuale Obergrenze für den marktüblichen Preis festlegen. Jede Buchung, die die prozentuale Obergrenze überschreitet, löst dann beim Genehmiger eine Benachrichtigung aus. Wir empfehlen, 20 % festzulegen, um eine gewisse Flexibilität zu gewährleisten.\nZusätzlich zur Festlegung einer dynamischen Richtlinie können Sie auch einen Höchstpreis pro Nacht für Hotels festlegen. Wir schlagen vor, sich ausschließlich auf die dynamische Richtlinie zu verlassen und den Höchstpreis bei 0 € zu belassen.\n\nHinweis: Wenn Sie sowohl eine dynamische Richtlinie als auch eine Höchstpreisrichtlinie festgelegt haben, wird der niedrigere der beiden Werte als Preisobergrenze verwendet. Wenn Sie beispielsweise einen Marktpreis von 200 € mit einer dynamischen Richtlinie von 20 % und einen Höchstpreis von 300 € haben, wird alles, was über 240 € pro Nacht liegt, als außerhalb der Richtlinie liegend gekennzeichnet, da der dynamische Preis mit den zusätzlichen 20 % weniger als 300 € beträgt.\n \n\nZimmer\nEs gibt zwei Möglichkeiten zur Buchung von Hotelzimmern, die sich durch Erstattungsrichtlinien unterscheiden:\n\nErlaubt sind alle Zimmer: Erstattungsfähige und nicht erstattungsfähige Buchungen sind zulässig.\nErlaubt sind nur erstattungsfähige Zimmer: Gebuchte Zimmer, die nicht erstattungsfähig sind, werden als nicht vertragsgemäß gekennzeichnet. Hinweis: Bei dieser Option werden auch die meisten Hotelbuchungen, die am selben Tag getätigt werden als nicht vertragsgemäß eingestuft, da sie wahrscheinlich außerhalb der Standardstornierungsfrist liegen, die die meisten Hotels zulassen.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\nWir empfehlen die Verwendung von „Erlaubt sind alle Zimmer“, da die Reisenden die Stornierungsbedingungen vor der Buchung bestätigen müssen. Dies bietet Ihren Reisenden die größtmögliche Flexibilität bei der Buchung und erhöht die Wahrscheinlichkeit von Einsparungen.\n \n\nVorlaufzeit\nHotels bieten bei Last-Minute-Buchungen oft einen Preisnachlass an, weil sie freie Zimmer besetzen wollen. Wir empfehlen Ihnen daher, die Vorlaufzeit für Hotels bei 0 Tagen zu belassen.\n \n\nBuchungsgenehmigung\nSie haben zwei Genehmigungsverfahren zur Auswahl:\n\nLeichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie: Die für die Reisegenehmigung zuständigen Personen werden per E-Mail benachrichtigt, wenn einer Ihrer Reisenden eine Buchung außerhalb der Richtlinien vornimmt, und haben die Möglichkeit, die Buchung zu stornieren. Wird jedoch nichts unternommen, so bleibt die Buchung bestätigt.\nKeine Freigabe erforderlich: Reisegenehmiger erhalten keine Benachrichtigungen, wenn Reisende außerhalb der ihnen zugewiesenen Richtlinien buchen.\nEs besteht die zusätzliche Möglichkeit, jeder Richtliniengruppe einen Buchungsgenehmiger zuzuweisen. Diese Person wird zum Standard-Genehmiger für alle Buchungen, die nicht den Richtlinien entsprechen oder die den festgelegten Preis überschreiten.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\nUm eine bessere Sichtbarkeit und Kontrolle über die Einhaltung der Reiserichtlinien zu gewährleisten, empfiehlt TripActions den ersten Genehmigungsprozess.  \n\nDas Hinzufügen eines Buchungsgenehmigers ist für Richtliniengruppen geeignet, die eine zentrale Aufsicht erfordern. Diese Option eignet sich für Unternehmen, die einen guten Überblick über ihre Ausgabengewohnheiten und Buchungen außerhalb der Richtlinien haben möchten.\n \nErzielen Sie höhere Einsparungen mit TripActions Rewards\nUnsere erfolgreichsten Kunden nutzen das TripActions Rewards-Programm, um zusätzliche Einsparungen zu erzielen, indem sie Reisende dazu motivieren, kostenbewusste Hotels und Mietwagen zu buchen. Um mehr darüber zu erfahren, wie das TripActions Rewards-Programm die Einsparungen, die Akzeptanz und die Zufriedenheit der Reisenden erhöht, lesen Sie diesen Beitrag. ",

    "body": "Zentrale Zahlungsmethode für Unternehmen hinzufügen\nUnternehmens-Administratoren können zentrale Zahlungsmethoden, wie z. B. Firmenkreditkarten, hinzufügen, sodass diese von Reisenden bei der Reisebuchung auf TripActions verwenden werden können. Außerdem können zentralisierte Zahlungsmethoden so konfiguriert werden, dass sie nur für bestimmte Untergruppen von Benutzern oder für bestimmte Buchungsarten zur Verfügung stehen. Mehr dazu erfahren Sie weiter unten.\n \nHinweis: Eine Anleitung, wie Sie eine von einer Fluggesellschaft ausgegebene UATP-Kreditkarte als Zahlungsmethode für Unternehmen hinzufügen können, finden Sie in diesem Artikel.\n \n\nHinzufügen einer neuen Zahlungsmethode\nWählen Sie im Admin Dashboard Einstellungen > Übersicht.\nGehen Sie zu Reisezahlungsmethoden und klicken Sie auf + Neue Karte hinzufügen.\nHinterlegen Sie für jede neue Karte den Namen und die Daten der Karte, die Rechnungsadresse und geben Sie die folgenden Daten an:\nBerechtigungen für die Kartennutzung: Beschränken Sie über Ihrer TripActions-Benutzerliste die Nutzung der Karte auf eine bestimmte Abteilung, Kostenstelle, Region oder Tochtergesellschaft, oder erlauben Sie, dass die Karte von allen Benutzern innerhalb des Unternehmens genutzt werden kann. Wenn Sie die Karte mehr als einer Abteilung, Kostenstelle, Region oder Tochtergesellschaft zuweisen möchten, dann können Sie dieselbe Karte einfach mehrfach hinzufügen. Wenn Sie zum Beispiel eine Unternehmenskarte für Reisende in Deutschland und in Frankreich hinzufügen möchten, geben Sie die Karteninformationen zweimal ein: einmal für die Region Deutschland und einmal für die Region Frankreich.\nFür welche Buchungsarten kann diese Karte verwendet werden?: Wählen Sie die Buchungsarten aus, für welche die Karte verfügbar sein soll (Flüge, Hotels, Bahn, Mietwagen, Black-Cars).\nGastbuchungen: Geben Sie an, ob die Karte für Gastbuchungen verfügbar sein soll, die über die Funktion Gast einladen vorgenommen wurden.\nKlicken Sie auf Speichern, um zu speichern und zu schließen.\nGeben Sie auf der Seite Reisezahlungsmittel die Verfügbarkeit der Karte nach Buchungsart an:\nVorrangig: Die Karte wird für die zugeordneten Reisenden die einzige verfügbare Zahlungsoption sein; d. h. die Reisenden können weder eine andere Zahlungsmethode des Unternehmens noch eine persönliche Zahlung verwenden. Sie können nicht mehr als eine Zahlungsmethode als vorrangig markieren.\nVerfügbar: Die Karte wird den zugewiesenen Reisenden als Zahlungsoption angezeigt; die Reisenden können auch aus anderen als verfügbar gekennzeichneten Zahlungsmethoden des Unternehmens wählen oder eine persönliche Karte verwenden.\nNicht verfügbar: Die Karte wird beim Bezahlvorgang nicht als Zahlungsoption zur Verfügung stehen.\nWählen Sie Bearbeiten oder Löschen, um gespeicherte Karten zu verwalten.\n \nEmpfehlungen nach Buchungstyp\nFlüge: Alle Flüge müssen beim Check-out vollständig bezahlt werden. Falls alle Flugbuchungen und Zahlungen über eine einheitliche Karte laufen sollen, müssen Sie die Option Vorrangig wählen. Empfehlungen zu den Berechtigungen von UATP-Karten, die von Fluggesellschaften ausgegeben werden, finden Sie in diesem Artikel.\n \nHotels: Viele Hotels bieten eine Zahlungsoption „Zahlung im Hotel“ an, d. h. ein Reisender kann das Zimmer reservieren, muss aber bei seiner Ankunft im Hotel mit einer Kreditkarte bezahlen. Wenn Sie eine Vorauszahlung der Hotelbuchungen bevorzugen, sollten Sie immer die Hoteloptionen auswählen, die als Vorauszahlung gekennzeichnet sind. Bitte beachten Sie, dass die Reisenden trotzdem eine Kreditkarte vorlegen müssen, um eventuelle Nebenkosten zu begleichen.  \n \nBahn: Alle Zugtickets müssen beim Bezahlvorgang vollständig bezahlt werden. Falls alle Zugbuchungen und Zahlungen über eine einheitliche Karte laufen sollen, müssen Sie die Option Vorrangig wählen.\n \nMietwagen: Sie können auf TripActions einen Mietwagen über eine einheitliche Zahlungsmethode reservieren. Allerdings verlangen die Mietwagenunternehmen, dass beim Check-in eine physische Karte vorgelegt wird, die auf den Namen des Fahrers ausgestellt ist. Sollten Sie die Zahlungen über eine einheitliche Zahlungsmethode abwickeln wollen, wenden Sie sich an Ihren Customer Success Manager, um eine direkte Abrechnung zu vereinbaren.\n \nBlack-Cars: Buchungen für Black-Cars können über eine einheitliche Zahlungsmethode reserviert werden und werden von dem Anbieter nach erfolgter Fahrt in Rechnung gestellt. Falls alle Black-Car-Buchungen über eine einheitliche Karte laufen sollen, müssen Sie die Option Vorrangig wählen.\n \nGästeeinladungen: Unternehmensadministratoren können die verfügbaren Zahlungsarten für Gästeeinladungen festlegen. Das Tool für Gästeeinladungen erfordert, dass der Ersteller der Einladung eine Zahlungsart auswählt, die für die gesamte Reise des Gastes verwendet werden soll. Der Ersteller des Ereignisses wählt aus einer Dropdown-Liste der verfügbaren Zahlungsmethoden für Gästeeinladungen oder bietet dem Gast die Möglichkeit, eine persönliche Karte zu verwenden. Wir empfehlen, dass die Administratoren den Gästen eine oder mehrere Kreditkarten zur Verfügung stellen, damit sie keine persönliche Karte für Buchungen verwenden müssen. Hinweis: Die Karteninformationen sind für die Gäste zu keinem Zeitpunkt einsehbar.\n \nTeamreisen: Bei Buchungen für Teamreisen werden standardmäßig die jeweiligen Zahlungsmethoden verwendet, die den einzelnen Teilnehmern zur Verfügung stehen. Wenn Sie z. B. eine bestimmte Kreditkarte als vorrangig (erforderlich) für Geschäftsreisen eingestuft haben, dann können Teilnehmer nur diese Karte für ihre Veranstaltungsbuchungen verwenden. ",

    "body": "Reisegenehmigungen in TripActions\nTripActions bietet zwei Optionen für die Buchungsgenehmigung, damit Reiseprogrammmanager den vollen Überblick und die Kontrolle über die Buchungen ihrer Reisenden haben. Gleichzeitig können Sie ihnen genügend Spielraum bei der Buchung einräumen:\n\nLeichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie: Die Genehmigenden/Manager werden über Buchungen, die nicht den Richtlinien entsprechen, benachrichtigt und können diese innerhalb von 24 Stunden im Namen des Reisenden stornieren.\nKeine Freigabe erforderlich: Es werden keine Benachrichtigungen an die Genehmigenden/Manager gesendet, wenn Buchungen außerhalb der Richtlinie vorgenommen werden.\n \nGenehmigungsrichtlinien in TripActions festlegen\nSie können die Richtlinienkontrolle über den Abschnitt Buchungsgenehmigung auf den Konfigurationsseiten der Reiserichtlinie und der Gästerichtlinie für jeden Buchungstyp anwenden.\n\nimage.png\n \nLeichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie\nDie Option „Leicht Abweichung von der Richtlinie“ bietet Reisemanagern Kontrolle und Transparenz. Sie ermöglicht den Reisenden gleichzeitig die nötige Flexibilität, um Reisen zu buchen, die ihren Anforderungen entsprechen.\n\nWenn die Option „Leichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie“ ausgewählt wird, gilt sie für alle dieser Richtlinie zugewiesenen Benutzer. Die Reisegenehmigenden (oder-manager) für diese Benutzer werden dann bei jeder nicht den Richtlinien entsprechenden Buchung, per E-Mail benachrichtigt. Sobald die E-Mail mit dem Verstoß gegen die Richtlinie versendet wurde, hat der Empfänger die Möglichkeit, die Buchung zu stornieren, indem er innerhalb von 24 Stunden* nach Versand der E-Mail auf Buchung stornieren klickt. Wenn der Empfänger auf Buchung stornieren klickt, wird er zur TripActions-Plattform weitergeleitet, um auf Stornierung bestätigen zu klicken und dem Reisenden einen Grund für die Stornierung zu nennen.\n\nBuchungen, die außerhalb der Richtlinie liegen, können auch von Administratoren auf der Seite Genehmigungen im Admin Dashboard oder von Reisegenehmigenden im Manager Dashboard eingesehen werden.\n\n*Das Zeitfenster von 24 Stunden, um eine Buchung zu stornieren, kann sich von dem Zeitfenster für die Stornierung der Buchung unterscheiden, so dass bei einer Stornierung möglicherweise keine Erstattung erfolgt. Die zuständigen Genehmigenden können die Informationen zur Stornierung und Erstattung direkt in der E-Mail-Benachrichtigung über den Verstoß gegen die Richtlinie einsehen.\n\nReisegenehmigende übergehen\nAdministratoren können andere Benutzer innerhalb ihres Unternehmens mit der Genehmigung von Buchungen beauftragen, die außerhalb der Richtlinien liegen. Weitere Informationen finden Sie in diesem Artikel.\n\nBuchungsprozess für Reisende\nBuchungsoptionen, die gegen die Richtlinien verstoßen, werden Reisenden bei jeder Flug-, Hotel-, Bahn- oder Mietwagensuche angezeigt. Auf der Seite mit den Suchergebnissen sowie auf der Seite mit den Details zum Angebot (z. B. die Seite mit den Zimmerdetails bei Hotelbuchungen) werden diese mit einem Symbol gekennzeichnet. Wenn der Reisende den Mauszeiger darüber bewegt, wird der Grund für den Verstoß gegen die Richtlinie angezeigt. Reisende können die ihnen zugewiesenen Bestimmungen auch auf der Suchseite einsehen, indem sie auf Meine [Flug-, Hotel-, Auto-, Bahn-] Richtlinie klicken.\n\nimage.png\n\nEntscheidet sich ein Reisender, eine Buchung außerhalb der Richtlinien vorzunehmen, wird er auf der Check-out-Seite aufgefordert, den Grund für die Buchung außerhalb der Richtlinien anzugeben und zu bestätigen, dass die Buchung von seinem Manager storniert werden kann. Wenn eine Buchung, die nicht den Richtlinien entspricht, vom Genehmigenden storniert wird, erhält der Reisende eine E-Mail sowie eine Benachrichtigung auf allen anderen Kanälen, die in seinen Profileinstellungen aktiviert sind (z. B. SMS oder Push-Benachrichtigungen).\n \n\nKeine Freigabe erforderlich\nWenn die Option Keine Genehmigung erforderlich ausgewählt ist, gilt sie für alle Benutzer, die dieser Richtlinie zugewiesen sind. Es werden keine Benachrichtigungen über Richtlinienüberschreitungen an die Reisegenehmigenden gesendet, unabhängig davon, ob Buchungen gegen die dem Benutzer zugewiesenen Richtlinien verstoßen.\n \n\nGenehmigungen für Gastbuchungen\nInformationen zu Genehmigungen für Buchungen, die über das Tool für Gästeeinladungen vorgenommen wurden, finden Sie im Abschnitt Einladungsersteller und Gästeerlebnis in diesem Artikel.\n \n\nHäufig gestellte Fragen\nF: [Angenommen, „Leichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie“ wurde ausgewählt] Eine Abweichung von der Richtlinie wurde von einem Administrator im Namen eines anderen Reisenden gebucht. Warum wurde keine E-Mail über eine Abweichung von der Richtlinie gesendet?\nA: Administratoren haben keine Möglichkeit, Richtlinien zu genehmigen. Wenn also ein Unternehmensadministrator im Namen eines Kollegen bucht und dabei eine Buchung außerhalb der ihm zugewiesenen Richtlinie vornimmt, wird der Prozess für den Verstoß gegen die Richtlinie außer Kraft gesetzt. In diesem Fall ist der Buchende ein Unternehmensadministrator, der die Möglichkeit hat, die Unternehmensrichtlinien festzulegen.\n\nF: Wie erfolgt die Genehmigung für leichte Abweichungen von der Richtlinie, wenn ein Stellvertreter bucht?\nA: Wenn ein Stellvertreter für einen anderen Reisenden bucht, indem er sich für diesen in TripActions anmeldet, gelten für alle Buchungen die diesem Reisenden zugewiesenen Richtlinien (nicht die Richtlinien des Stellvertreters). Sollte ein Stellvertreter über sein eigenes Profil für einen anderen Reisenden buchen, gelten für alle vorgenommenen Buchungen seine eigenen (des Stellvertreters) zugewiesenen Richtlinien.\n\nF: Werden Buchungen, die über Trip Proposal vorgenommen werden, weiterhin als außerhalb der Richtlinien liegend markiert?  \nA: Ja. Buchungen, die über Trip Proposal vorgenommen werden, unterliegen immer noch den Richtlinien und dem Genehmigungsprozess, die dem Reisenden zugewiesen sind. ",

Um Einblicke in die Buchungsgewohnheiten und Ausgaben Ihres Unternehmens zu erhalten, empfehlen wir den Verwaltern, die Daten aus dem Analyse-Dashboard zu nutzen. Lesen Sie weiter, um mehr über die bewährte Verfahren für die Festlegung Ihrer Richtlinien zu erfahren.\n \nEine ausführliche Anleitung zur Konfiguration und Zuweisung von Richtlinien im TripActions-Konto Ihres Unternehmens finden Sie in diesem Beitrag.\n\nimage.png\n \nKosten\nIn den Richtlinien für Zugbuchungen können Sie einen maximalen Fahrpreis für Ihre Mitarbeitenden festlegen (dieser Höchstpreis gilt sowohl für den Kauf von Einzelfahrscheinen als auch für Rückfahrkarten). Wenn Sie einen Höchstpreis festlegen, werden Tickets, deren Preis über diesem Höchstwert liegt, für Ihre Reisenden mit einem Symbol zur Überschreitung der Richtlinien gekennzeichnet. Sollten Sie keine Höchstpreis festlegen wollen, sollte der Preis bei 0 € belassen werden.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nWir empfehlen, nur dann eine Höchstpreisrichtlinie für Zugbuchungen festzulegen, wenn Ihr Unternehmen TripActions seit mindestens drei Monaten für die Buchung von Zugreisen verwendet. Erhalten Sie über das Analyse-Dashboard Einblicke in die durchschnittlichen Ticketkosten. Sollten keine Daten über die Ausgaben für Zugreisen vorliegen, schlagen wir vor, den Höchstpreis bei 0 € zu belassen.\n \nHöchste zulässige Abteil-Klassen\nDie Abteil-Klassen, die Sie den Reisenden zur Verfügung stellen, sollten ein Gleichgewicht zwischen Ihrer Unternehmenskultur, dem Reisebudget und der Sicherheit und dem Komfort der Reisenden herstellen. Bei Zugbuchungen können Sie wählen, ob Sie nur Buchungen in der Zweiten oder in der Ersten Klasse zulassen. Die Preise für die einzelnen Klassen variieren je nach Zuggesellschaft und Strecke. Erste-Klasse-Abteile bieten in der Regel breitere Sitze und mehr Beinfreiheit und sollten in Betracht gezogen werden, wenn Ihre Reisenden häufig lange Zugreisen buchen.\n \n\nVorlaufzeit\nPreis und Vorlaufzeit sind bei Zugbuchungen eng miteinander verknüpft. Sie werden feststellen, dass die Preise steigen, sobald das Abfahrtsdatum des Zuges weniger als 14 Tage beträgt und weniger Plätze zur Verfügung stehen.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nTripActions empfiehlt eine 14-tägige Vorlaufzeit für Zugbuchungen, um das Buchungsverhalten zu fördern und die größten Einsparungen zu erzielen. Diese Zahl sollte mit den geschäftlichen Anforderungen und den Buchungsgewohnheiten der Reisenden abgeglichen werden, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Richtlinie angemessen und effektiv ist.\n \nBuchungsgenehmigung\nZurzeit sind keine Genehmigungen für Zugbuchungen verfügbar. Wenn ein Höchstpreis festgelegt wurde, werden Tickets, deren Preis über dem Höchstpreis liegt, auf der Seite mit den Suchergebnissen mit einem Symbol außerhalb der Richtlinie gekennzeichnet. Buchungen, die über den Höchstpreis hinausgehen, können jedoch weiterhin vorgenommen werden, ohne dass der vom Reisenden benannte Genehmiger benachrichtigt wird.",

    "body": "Reisebezahlung mit von Fluggesellschaften ausgegebenen UATP-Karten\nUATP, oder Universal Air Travel Plan, ist eine globale Lösung für die Bezahlung von Geschäftsreisen, die von Fluggesellschaften weltweit betrieben wird. UATP-Karten können von Fluggesellschaften in Form einer Kreditkarte, einer United PassPlus-oder Priority Plus-Karte oder einer Prepaid-Karte (Karten, die mit Guthaben von Fluggesellschaften aufgeladen werden) ausgestellt werden und werden von vielen Unternehmen als zentralisierte Zahlungsmethode für Reisen genutzt.\n \nBestehende Kunden mit Administrator-Zugang können von Fluggesellschaften ausgegebene UATP-Kreditkarten als Firmenzahlung für ihr Unternehmen in die TripActions-Plattform laden, indem sie die unten beschriebenen Schritte ausführen. Kunden, die eine PassPlus oder Priority Plus UATP Karte als Firmenzahlungsmittel hinzufügen möchten, sollten sich an ihren TripActions Customer Success Manager wenden.\n \n\nEine UATP-Karte als Zahlungsmethode hinzufügen\nKlicken Sie auf dem Admin Dashboard auf Einstellungen und wählen Sie dann Übersicht.\nKlicken Sie im Abschnitt Reisezahlungsmethoden auf + Neue Karte hinzufügen.\nGeben Sie einen Kartennamen ein, der für Ihre Reisenden auf der Check-out-Seite sichtbar sein wird.\nGeben Sie die Kartennummer ein:\nUATP-Kartennummern haben 15 Ziffern und keinen CVC.\nSobald Sie Ihre UATP-Kartennummer eingegeben haben, erkennt TripActions das Zahlungsmittel automatisch als UATP-Karte an.\nSobald eine UATP-Karte erkannt wurde, erscheint das Feld Ausgeber/Airline. Dieses Feld stellt sicher, dass die UATP-Karte als Zahlungsmittel angezeigt wird, wenn ein Reisender einen Flug mit der entsprechenden Fluggesellschaft bucht (d. h. eine von der Lufthansa ausgestellte UATP-Karte wird für einen Reisenden angezeigt, der einen Lufthansa-Flug auswählt, jedoch nicht für einen Flug mit einer anderen Fluggesellschaft).\nBeginnen Sie mit der Eingabe des Namens der Fluggesellschaft und wählen Sie aus dem Dropdown-Menü die gewünschte Fluggesellschaft aus\nSollte das Feld Ausgeber/Airline nicht angezeigt werden, vergewissern Sie sich bitte, dass die UATP-Kartennummer korrekt eingegeben wurde\nWählen Sie im Feld für die Zahlung von Nachzahlungen und Gebühren eine Zahlungsart für die Reisegebühren aus  \nVon der Fluggesellschaft ausgestellte UATP-Karten können nur zur Bezahlung des Flugpreises und nicht zur Bezahlung weiterer Reisegebühren Ihrer Reisenden verwendet werden. Um die Kosten für die Reisegebühren in Fällen zu decken, in denen Ihre Reisenden Flugreisen auf der TripActions-Plattform mit einer UATP-Karte buchen, müssen Sie eine zusätzliche Zahlungsmethode des Unternehmens auswählen oder eingeben.\nUnter Kartennutzungsberechtigungen können Sie die Kartennutzung auf eine bestimmte Abteilung, Kostenstelle, Region und/oder Tochtergesellschaft beschränken. Sie können diese Einstellung auch so belassen, dass die Karte für alle Benutzer in Ihrem Unternehmen verfügbar ist.\nHinweis: Wenn Sie die Karte mehr als einer Abteilung, Kostenstelle, Region oder Tochtergesellschaft zuweisen müssen, dann können Sie dieselbe Karte einfach mehrfach hinzufügen. Wenn Sie beispielsweise dieselbe Unternehmenskarte für Ihre Benutzer in den Deutschland und in Frankreich hinzufügen möchten, geben Sie die Karteninformationen ein und wählen Sie die Region Deutschland aus, dann geben Sie die Karteninformationen erneut ein und wählen Sie die Region Frankreich aus.\nGehen Sie auf Flüge und markieren Sie unter Welche Arten von Buchungen können mit der Karte durchgeführt werden die Karte als Verfügbar.\nIm nächsten Abschnitt finden Sie weitere Informationen zur Verfügbarkeitslogik der UATP-Karten.\nWählen Sie aus,  ob die Karte für Gästeeinladungen zur Verfügung stehen soll.\nDerzeit können Gästeeinladungen nur mit einer Zahlungsart für alle Buchungen verbunden werden, daher empfehlen wir Ihnen, diese Zahlungsart nicht für Gästeeinladungen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Das heißt, dass keine andere Zahlungsart angezeigt wird, wenn ein Gast einen Flug außerhalb des UATP-Fluganbieters bucht.\nKlicken Sie auf Speichern, um den Vorgang abzuschließen\n \nDie von Fluggesellschaften ausgestellten UATP-Karten als verfügbar oder obligatorisch kennzeichnen\nWenn Sie von Fluggesellschaften ausgegebene UATP-Karten als Zahlungsmethode für Ihr Unternehmen für Flugbuchungen hinzufügen, empfehlen wir Ihnen, diese in Ihren Karteneinstellungen immer als VERFÜGBAR zu markieren (und nicht als vorrangig). UATP-Karten, die als verfügbar markiert sind, werden immer als Zahlungsmittel angezeigt, wenn Ihre Reisenden Flüge einer passenden Fluggesellschaft auswählen. Auch wenn eine andere Zahlungsmethode, die nicht von der UATP-Gesellschaft stammt, als verfügbar markiert wurde, wird sie dem Reisenden nicht angezeigt. Die Reisenden haben jedoch die Möglichkeit, eine persönliche Zahlungsmethode hinzuzufügen, wenn sie die vorgestellte UATP-Zahlungsmethode nicht nutzen möchten.\n \nVon Fluggesellschaften ausgestellte UATP-Karten sollten NICHT als vorrangig für Flugbuchungen markiert werden, da sie nicht für nicht übereinstimmende Flüge verwendet werden können und die Markierung als vorrangig die Verwendung einer anderen Zahlungsmethode (vom Unternehmen bereitgestellt oder vom Reisenden eingegeben) verhindert.\n \n\nHäufig gestellte Fragen\nF: Kann eine AirPlus UATP-Karte in TripActions geladen werden?\nA: Zurzeit unterstützt TripActions keine von AirPlus ausgestellten UATP-Karten.\n \nF: Wer ist für die Belastung der UATP-Kreditkarten zuständig?\nA: Der Anbieter des Fluginventars belastet die UATP-Kreditkarten. TripActions belastet die Karte nicht.\n \nF: Welche Karten werden bei Buchungen mit mehreren Fluggesellschaften auf der Check-Out-Seite angezeigt, wenn eine von einer Fluggesellschaft ausgestellte UATP-Karte verfügbar ist?\nA: Zurzeit wird dem Reisenden auf der Check-Out-Seite keine UATP-Karte angezeigt, wenn eine Buchung mehrere Fluggesellschaften umfasst.\n \nF: Meine Reisenden berichten, dass sie mit einer verfügbaren, von der Fluggesellschaft ausgestellten UATP-Karte keine Flüge buchen können. Was sollte ich tun?\nA: Setzen Sie sich mit der ausstellenden Fluggesellschaft in Verbindung, um sich zu vergewissern, dass das Guthaben auf der Karte ausreicht, um die Kosten für den/die betreffenden Flug/Flüge zu decken. Überprüfen Sie, ob das Ablaufdatum der Karte in den Karteneinstellungen in TripActions korrekt eingegeben wurde. Da viele Fluggesellschaften das Ablaufdatum ihrer UATP-Karten aufgrund der COVID-19-Pandemie verlängert haben, kann sich das ursprünglich in TripActions eingegebene Ablaufdatum nachträglich geändert haben und muss daher aktualisiert werden.

    "body": "Die Dynamische Richtlinie von TripActions\nDie dynamische Richtlinie von TripActions ermöglicht es Ihnen, Ihre Reiseausgaben zu regulieren, indem Sie Ihren Reisenden einen Kostenrichtwert an die Hand geben, der sich an den üblichen Marktpreisen für deren Reiseziel und Reisedaten orientiert. TripActions analysiert hierbei zum Beispiel bei jeder Flugsuche alle geeigneten Suchergebnisse und berechnet dann einen Median-Preis. Bei der Suche nach Hotels und Autos wird die gleiche Methode angewandt und als Bestpreis bezeichnet.\n\nUm Ihnen ein konkretes Beispiel zu geben, sei hier die Buchung von einer Reise nach San Francisco exemplarisch genannt – einer Stadt, in der viele große Veranstaltungen stattfinden, wie z.B. die Dreamforce von Salesforce. Solche Ereignisse tendieren dazu, erhebliche Preisschwankungen sowohl bei Flügen als auch bei Hotels zu verursachen. Wird den Reisenden eine statische Preisobergrenze präsentiert, denken viele von ihnen: „Ich kann bis zu ...“ ausgeben. Das bedeutet, dass viele Reisende den ihnen angezeigten fairen Marktpreis ignorieren und den vollen möglichen Betrag ausgeben werden, der ihnen gemäß den Richtlinien ihres Unternehmens zusteht, da diese Buchungen technisch gesehen mit den Richtlinien konform sind, Wird hingegen eine dynamische Richtlinie angewandt, werden sich die Reisenden auf den fairen Marktpreis als Buchungsmaßstab konzentrieren und seltener zu hohen Ausgaben neigen.\n\nDynamische Richtlinien in TripActions konfigurieren\nSie haben die Möglichkeit dynamische Richtlinien für Ihre Mitarbeiter als auch für Gästebuchungen anzuwenden. Diese greifen für Flüge, Hotels und Mietwagen. So richten Sie eine dynamische Richtlinien ein:\n\nNavigieren Sie zum Admin Dashboard und wählen Sie Richtlinie aus.\nWählen Sie aus dem Dropdown-Menü die Option Reiserichtlinie oder Gästerichtlinie.\nWählen Sie eine Richtlinienkategorie (z. B. Flüge) und navigieren Sie zum Abschnitt Kosten .\nWählen Sie nun die Gruppe von Benutzern oder Personen, für die Sie eine dynamische Richtlinie hinzufügen oder ändern möchten, und klicken Sie in die Spalte Richtlinie.\nGeben Sie im Feld Dynamische Richtlinie die prozentuale Obergrenze über dem Median-Preis/Bestpreis ein, den Sie festlegen möchten.\nTripActions empfiehlt, eine Obergrenze von 20 % festzulegen und den Maximalpreis bei 0 € zu belassen. Wenn Sie den Maximalpreis bei 0 € belassen, wird der Bestpreis durch das dynamische Preismodell bestimmt. Wenn Sie eine Obergrenze von 20 % wählen, werden nur solche Buchungen als unzulässig eingestuft, die 20 % oder mehr über dem Bestpreis liegen.\nSollten Sie es bevorzugen, einen Maximalpreis pro Buchung festzulegen, und möchten Sie mehr darüber erfahren, wie Preisobergrenzen und eine dynamische Preisgestaltung zusammenhängen, dann lesen Sie diesen Artikel.\n",

    "body": "Empfehlung für die Festlegung von Richtlinien für die Autovermietung\nBei der Festlegung von Richtlinien für die Autovermietung unterstützen wir Sie dabei, den Wunsch nach Kostenkontrolle und Transparenz mit einem guten Buchungs- und Reiseerlebnis für die Mitarbeitenden in Einklang zu bringen. Um Einblicke in die Buchungsgewohnheiten und Ausgaben Ihres Unternehmens zu erhalten, empfehlen wir den Verwaltern, die Daten aus dem Analyse-Dashboard zu nutzen. Lesen Sie weiter, um mehr über die bewährten Verfahren für die Festlegung Ihrer Richtlinien zu erfahren.\n \nEine ausführliche Anleitung zur Konfiguration und Zuweisung von Richtlinien im TripActions-Konto Ihres Unternehmens finden Sie in diesem Beitrag.\n\nimage.png\n \nKosten\nMit einer dynamischen Richtlinie können Sie am besten sicherstellen, dass Ihre Reisenden je nach Reisedatum und -ort eine preisgünstige Autovermietung buchen. Bei der dynamischen Preisgestaltung werden alle sinnvollen Ergebnisse ausgewertet und ein Price to Beat (fairer Marktpreis) für die Suche berechnet.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nUm einen besseren Überblick über die Ausgaben der Reisenden zu erhalten und die Kostenkontrolle zu verbessern, können Sie mithilfe der dynamischen Richtlinie eine prozentuale Obergrenze für den marktüblichen Preis festlegen. Jede Buchung, die die prozentuale Obergrenze überschreitet, löst dann beim Genehmiger eine Benachrichtigung aus. Wir empfehlen, 20 % festzulegen, um eine gewisse Flexibilität zu gewährleisten.\nZusätzlich zur Festlegung einer dynamischen Richtlinie können Sie auch einen Höchstpreis pro Nacht für Hotels festlegen. Wir schlagen vor, sich ausschließlich auf die dynamische Richtlinie zu verlassen und den Höchstpreis bei 0 € zu belassen.\nHinweis: Wenn Sie sowohl eine dynamische Richtlinie als auch einen Höchstpreis festgelegt haben, wird der niedrigere der beiden Werte als Preisobergrenze verwendet. Wenn Sie z. B. einen Marktpreis von 40 € mit einer dynamischen Richtlinie von 20 % und einer Preisobergrenze von 50 € festgelegt haben, wird alles, was über 48 € pro Tag liegt, als außerhalb der Richtlinie liegend gekennzeichnet, da der dynamische Preis mit den zusätzlichen 20 % unter 50 € liegt.\n \n\nKomfort\nWir empfehlen, dass Unternehmen mit bevorzugten Mietwagenanbietern und ermäßigten Tarifen die Option „Classes allowed“ nutzen. In den Verträgen werden oft bestimmte Fahrzeugklassen genannt, die für ermäßigte Tarife in Frage kommen. Wir empfehlen, Ihre Verträge auf diese Klassen abzustimmen, damit die Reisenden die ermäßigten Tarife in Anspruch nehmen können. Verwenden Sie die Option „Benutzerdefiniert“, um anzugeben, welche Klassen Sie für jede Richtliniengruppe zulassen möchten (z. B. Economy, Compact, Electric, Hybrid, Luxury, usw.).\n \n\nVorlaufzeit\nDie Preise für Autovermietungen hängen eher von der Verfügbarkeit als von der Vorlaufzeit ab. Wir empfehlen, die Vorlaufzeit für Fahrzeugbuchungen bei 0 Tagen zu belassen (unbegrenzt).  \n \n\nBuchungsgenehmigung\nIhnen stehen zwei Genehmigungsverfahren zur Auswahl:\n\nLeichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie: Die für die Reisegenehmigung zuständigen Personen werden per E-Mail benachrichtigt, wenn einer ihrer Reisenden eine Buchung außerhalb der Richtlinien vornimmt, und haben die Möglichkeit, die Buchung zu stornieren. Wird jedoch nichts unternommen, so bleibt die Buchung bestätigt.\nKeine Freigabe erforderlich: Reisegenehmiger erhalten keine Benachrichtigungen, wenn Reisende außerhalb der ihnen zugewiesenen Richtlinien buchen.\nEs besteht die zusätzliche Möglichkeit, jeder Richtliniengruppe einen Buchungsgenehmiger zuzuweisen. Diese Person wird zum Standard-Genehmiger für alle Buchungen, die nicht den Richtlinien entsprechen oder die den festgelegten Preis überschreiten.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nUm eine bessere Sichtbarkeit und Kontrolle über die Einhaltung der Reiserichtlinien zu gewährleisten, empfiehlt TripActions den ersten Genehmigungsprozess.  \nDas Hinzufügen eines Buchungsgenehmigers ist für Richtliniengruppen geeignet, die eine zentrale Aufsicht erfordern. Diese Option eignet sich für Unternehmen, die einen guten Überblick über ihre Ausgabengewohnheiten und Buchungen außerhalb der Richtlinien haben möchten.\n \nErzielen Sie höhere Einsparungen mit TripActions Rewards\nUnsere erfolgreichsten Kunden nutzen das TripActions Rewards-Programm, um zusätzliche Einsparungen zu erzielen, indem sie Reisende dazu motivieren, kostenbewusst Hotels und Mietwagen zu buchen.

    "body": "Empfehlung für die Festlegung von Richtlinien für Flugbuchungen\nBei der Festlegung von Richtlinien für Reisen mit dem Flugzeug unterstützen wir Sie dabei, den Wunsch nach Kostenkontrolle und Transparenz mit einem guten Buchungs- und Reiseerlebnis für die Mitarbeitenden in Einklang zu bringen. In diesem Beitrag erfahren Sie, wie Sie eine Flugrichtlinie in TripActions einrichten und wie Sie Ihre Einstellungen am besten wählen. Um Einblicke in die Buchungsgewohnheiten und Ausgaben Ihres Unternehmens zu erhalten, empfehlen wir den Verwaltern, die Daten aus dem Analyse-Dashboard zu nutzen. Lesen Sie weiter, um mehr über die bewährte Verfahren für die Festlegung Ihrer Richtlinien zu erfahren.\n\nEine ausführliche Anleitung zur Konfiguration und Zuweisung von Richtlinien im TripActions-Konto Ihres Unternehmens finden Sie in diesem Beitrag.\n\nimage.png\n \nFlugdauer\nEs gibt drei Arten von Kategorien für die Richtliniengestaltung für Flugbuchungen:\n\nKurzstreckenflüge: Normalerweise geeignet für Flüge unter fünf Stunden\nMittelstreckenflüge: Diese werden automatisch auf der Grundlage Ihrer Kurz- und Langstreckenflugdauer angepasst\nLangstreckenflüge: Normalerweise geeignet für Flüge über acht Stunden\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\nDie Werte für Kurz-, Mittel- und Langstreckenflüge können in jeder Ihrer Richtliniengruppen geändert werden. So kann es beispielsweise vorteilhaft sein, die Dauer von Kurz-, Mittel- und Langstreckenflügen je nach Büro oder Region anzupassen. Sie können zum Beispiel eine Kurzstreckenrichtlinie in Europa von zwei Stunden und eine Kurzstreckenrichtlinie in den Vereinigten Staaten von sechs Stunden erstellen. Sie können auch in Erwägung ziehen, dass Ihre Kurzstreckenrichtlinie eine typische Inlandsflugdauer und Ihre Langstreckenrichtlinie eine internationale Flugdauer darstellt. Bei der Suche nach Flügen wird den Reisenden dann automatisch die ihnen zugewiesene Richtlinie auf der Grundlage der Flugdauer angezeigt.\n \n\nKosten\nMit einer dynamischen Richtlinie können Sie am besten sicherstellen, dass Ihre Reisenden je nach Reisedatum und -ort einen preisgünstigen Flug buchen. Bei der dynamischen Preisgestaltung werden alle sinnvollen Suchergebnisse ausgewertet und ein Durchschnittspreis (fairer Marktpreis) für die Suche berechnet.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nUm einen besseren Überblick über die Ausgaben der Reisenden zu erhalten und die Kostenkontrolle zu verbessern, können Sie eine prozentuale Obergrenze für den Durchschnittspreis festlegen. Jede Buchung, die die prozentuale Obergrenze überschreitet, löst dann beim Genehmiger eine Benachrichtigung aus. Wir empfehlen, 20 % festzulegen, um eine gewisse Flexibilität bei der Preisgestaltung zu gewährleisten.\nSie haben auch die Möglichkeit, einen Höchstpreis pro Buchung festzulegen. Wir schlagen vor, sich ausschließlich auf die dynamische Richtlinie zu verlassen und den Höchstpreis bei 0 € zu belassen.\n \nHinweis: Wenn Sie sowohl eine dynamische Richtlinie als auch eine Höchstpreisrichtlinie festgelegt haben, wird der niedrigere der beiden Werte als Preisobergrenze verwendet. Wenn Sie z. B. einen Durchschnittspreis von 450 € mit einer dynamischen Richtlinie von 20 % und einer Preisobergrenze von 500 € haben, wird alles, was über 500 USD liegt, als außerhalb der Richtlinie liegend gekennzeichnet, da 500 € weniger als 540 € (450 € x 20 %) sind.\n \n\nHöchste zulässige Abteilungen\nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nEs ist üblich, dass Kurzstreckenflüge nur in der Economy-Klasse gebucht werden können, wobei der Reisende die Möglichkeit hat, mit seiner eigenen Zahlungsmethode einen besseren Sitzplatz zu erwerben.\nBei der Richtlinie für Mittelstreckenflüge kann effektiv zwischen langen regionalen Reisen, wie z. B. von New York nach San Francisco, und internationalen Reisen, wie z. B. von New York nach Hongkong, unterschieden werden.\nViele Unternehmen entscheiden sich bei Langstreckenflügen für zusätzlichen Komfort, wie z. B. einen verbesserten Sitzplatz in der Economy-Klasse oder eine höhere Sitzklasse wie Premium Economy oder Business Class.\n \nErlaubte Upgrades\nUpgrades sollten ein Gleichgewicht zwischen Ihrer Unternehmenskultur, dem Reisebudget und der Sicherheit und dem Komfort der Reisenden herstellen.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nSie haben die Möglichkeit, eine höhere Sitzklasse zuzulassen, wenn diese billiger ist als die niedrigere Sitzklasse (was zwar selten vorkommt, aber doch gelegentlich, vor allem bei Buchungen kurz vor dem Reisedatum). Sie haben außerdem die Möglichkeit, eine höhere Sitzklasse zuzulassen, wenn der Preis nicht mehr als x % über dem maximal zulässigen Betrag liegt. Wenn Sie keine dieser beiden Optionen wählen, können Ihre Reisenden zwar eine höhere Sitzklasse buchen, doch wird dies für den Genehmiger als nicht richtlinienkonform gekennzeichnet.\nSitzplatz-Upgrades sind eine gute Möglichkeit, Ihren Reisenden zusätzlichen Komfort zu bieten, ohne dass sie für eine höhere Sitzklasse bezahlen müssen. Es wird empfohlen, diese Option zu aktivieren, wenn Sie Ihren Reisenden diese Möglichkeit zur Verfügung stellen wollen. Wenn diese Funktion nicht aktiviert ist, können Ihre Reisenden ihren Sitzplatz trotzdem upgraden, indem sie mit einem unserer Support-Mitarbeiter chatten und mit einer persönlichen Karte die Preisdifferenz bezahlen.\nViele Unternehmen bieten ihren Mitarbeitenden die Möglichkeit, eine komfortablere Sitzklasse zu wählen, wenn sie einen Red-Eye-Flug nehmen. Für Mittel- und Langstreckenflüge mit spätem Abflug und früher Ankunft am Morgen können Sie eine Red-Eye-Flugrichtlinie festlegen, die Ihren Reisenden ein Upgrade der Sitzklasse ermöglicht.\n \nVorlaufzeit\nDie Vorlaufzeit gibt an, wie lange im Voraus eine Reise gebucht werden sollte. Preis und Vorlaufzeit sind bei Flügen eng miteinander verknüpft, und Sie werden feststellen, dass die Preise innerhalb von 14 Tagen vor dem Abflugdatum und bei abnehmendem Bestand steigen.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nTripActions empfiehlt eine 14-tägige Vorlaufzeit für Flüge, um das Buchungsverhalten zu fördern, was zu den größten Einsparungen bei Flügen führt. Diese Zahl sollte mit den geschäftlichen Anforderungen und den Buchungsgewohnheiten der Reisenden abgeglichen werden, um sicherzustellen, dass Ihre Richtlinie angemessen und effektiv ist.\n \nBuchungsgenehmigung\nSie haben zwei Genehmigungsverfahren zur Auswahl:\n\nLeichte Abweichung von der Richtlinie: Die für die Reisegenehmigung zuständigen Personen werden per E-Mail benachrichtigt, wenn einer ihrer Reisenden eine Buchung außerhalb der Richtlinien vornimmt, und haben die Möglichkeit, die Buchung zu stornieren. Wird jedoch nichts unternommen, so bleibt die Buchung bestätigt.\nKeine Freigabe erforderlich: Reisegenehmiger erhalten keine Benachrichtigungen, wenn Reisende außerhalb der ihnen zugewiesenen Richtlinien buchen.\nEs besteht die zusätzliche Möglichkeit, für jede Richtliniengruppe einen Buchungsgenehmiger zuzuweisen. Diese Person wird zum Standard-Genehmiger für alle Buchungen, die nicht den Richtlinien entsprechen oder die den festgelegten Preis überschreiten.\n \nTipps und Empfehlungen\n\nUm eine bessere Sichtbarkeit und Kontrolle über die Einhaltung der Reiserichtlinien zu gewährleisten, empfiehlt TripActions den ersten Genehmigungsprozess.  \nDas Hinzufügen eines Buchungsgenehmigers ist für Richtliniengruppen geeignet, die eine zentrale Aufsicht erfordern. Diese Option eignet sich für Unternehmen, die einen guten Überblick über ihre Ausgabengewohnheiten und Buchungen außerhalb der Richtlinien haben möchten. ",

    "body": "Best Practices for Setting your Hotel Policies\nWhen setting a hotel policy, we encourage our customers to balance the desire for cost-control and visibility with a great booking and travel experience for employees. For insight into your company's booking habits and spend, we recommend that admins utilize data from the Analysis Dashboard. Read below to learn more about best practices for setting your policy. \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to configure and assign policies in your company's TripActions account, see this article. \n \n\nCost\nA dynamic policy is the best way to ensure your travelers are booking a reasonably priced hotel room based on the dates and location of travel. Dynamic pricing works by evaluating all of the reasonable results and calculating an Optimal price (fair market price) for the search. \n\nTips & Recommendations\n\nTo increase visibility into traveler spend and increase cost-control, use the dynamic policy to add a percentage cap over the fair market price. Any booking over the percentage cap will trigger an out-of-policy notification to the traveler's approver. We recommend choosing 20% to allow for some flexibility. \nIn addition to setting a dynamic policy, you can set a maximum price per night for hotels. We suggest relying solely on the dynamic policy and leaving the maximum price at $0. \nNote: If you have both a dynamic policy and a maximum price policy configured, the lower of the two values will be used as the price cap. For example, if you have a $200 optimal price with a 20% dynamic policy, and a $300 maximum price, anything above $240 per night will be flagged as out-of-policy because the dynamic price with the additional 20% is less than $300.\n\n\nRooms \nThere are two options for hotels rooms that vary by refund policy:\n\nAll for all rooms: Refundable and non-refundable bookings will be allowed\nAllow for refundable rooms only: Non-refundable rooms booked will be marked as out of policy. Note: This option will also trigger most same-day hotel bookings as out-of-policy since they will likely fall outside the standard cancellation period that most hotels permit. \n\nTips & Recommendations\n\nWe recommend using All rooms allowed as travelers must acknowledge the cancelation terms prior to making the booking. This will provide your travelers with the greatest booking flexibility and increase the likelihood of savings. \n \nLead Time\nHotels often offer last-minute reservations a price discount because properties want to fill vacant rooms. We recommend leaving the lead time for hotels at 0 days. \n \n\nBooking Approval\nThere are two approval flows to choose from:\n\nSoft Out-of-Policy: Travel approvers will be notified via email when an out-of-policy booking is made by one of their travelers and will have the ability to cancel the traveler's booking. If no action is taken, the booking will remain confirmed.\nNo Approval Required: Travel approvers will not receive any notifications when travelers book outside their assigned policy.\nThere is the additional option to assign an Override Booking Approver for each policy group. This individual will be the default approver for all out-of-policy bookings or bookings above the set price threshold. \n\nTips & Recommendations\n\nTo provide increased visibility and control over traveler policy compliance, TripActions recommends a Soft Out-of-Policy approval flow.  \nAdding an override approver is appropriate for policy groups that require centralized oversight. This option is appropriate for companies that want high visibility into spending habits and out-of-policy bookings. \n \n\nIncreasing Savings with TripActions Rewards\nOur most successful customers utilize the TripActions Rewards Program to drive additional savings by incentivizing travelers to book cost-conscious hotels and cars. To learn more about how the TripActions Rewards Program increases savings, adoption, and traveler satisfaction, view this article. ",

    "body": "Best Practices for Setting your Flight Policies\nSetting an appropriate flight policy for your company is typically a balance between cost-control and visibility with a great booking and travel experience for employees. For insight into your company's booking habits and spend, we recommend that admins utilize data from the Analysis Dashboard. Read below to learn more about best practices for setting your policy. \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to configure policies in your company's TripActions account, see this article. \n \n\nFlight Duration\nThere are three types of policy categories for flight bookings:\n\nShort flights: Typically appropriate for flights under five hours\n[Optional] Medium flights: This is automatically adjusted based on your short and long flight durations\nLong flights: Typically appropriate for flights over eight hours\n\nTips and Recommendations\n\nAdjusting the short, medium, and long flight durations may be advantageous based on office or region. For example, you can create a short policy in EMEA of 4 hours and a short policy in the United States of 6 hours.\nWe recommend thinking of the short flights as domestic and long flights as international/intercontinental.\nimage.png\n \nCost\nA dynamic policy is the best way to ensure your travelers are booking a reasonably priced flight based on the dates and location of travel. Dynamic pricing works by evaluating all reasonable search results and calculating a median price (a fair market price) for the search. \n\nTips and Recommendations\n\nTo increase visibility into traveler spend and increase cost control, add a percentage cap over the median price. Any booking over the percentage cap will trigger an out-of-policy notification to the traveler's approver. We recommend choosing 20% to allow for some flexibility in pricing. \nYou will also have the option to set a maximum price per booking. We suggest relying solely on the dynamic policy and leaving the maximum price at $0. \nNote: If you have both a dynamic policy and a maximum price policy configured, the lower of the two values will be used as the price cap. For example, if you have a $450 median price with a 20% dynamic policy, and a $500 price cap, anything above $500 will be flagged as out-of-policy because $500 is less than $540 ($450 x 20%).\n\nimage.png\n \nHighest Cabin Allowed\nTips and Recommendations\n\nIt is common for short trips to be restricted to Economy class bookings only, with the option for the traveler to purchase an upgraded seat using their own payment method.\nMedium duration flight policies can effectively distinguish between long regional trips, such as New York to San Francisco and international trips such as New York to Hong Kong. \nMany companies opt for additional comfort on long trips such as an upgraded seat within the Economy cabin, or a higher cabin class such as Premium Economy or Business Class.\nimage.png\n\nAllowed Upgrades\nUpgrades should balance your company culture, travel budgets, as well as traveler safety and comfort. \n\nTips and Recommendations\n\nYou have the option to allow a higher cabin class when it is cheaper than the lower cabin class (while rare, this does happen on occasion, especially when booking close to the travel date), and the option to allow for a higher cabin class if the price is not more than x% higher than the maximum allowed cabin. If you do not select either of these options, your travelers will still be able to book a higher cabin class, but it will be flagged as out of policy to their approver. \nSeat upgrades are a great way to allow for additional comfort for your travelers, without having to pay for a higher cabin class. It is recommended to have this enabled if you would like your travelers to have this option. If it is not enabled, travelers can upgrade their seat after the booking is complete, using a personal payment method.\nMany companies allow their employees to select a more comfortable cabin class when taking a red-eye flight. For medium and long-haul flights that have a late departure and early morning arrival, you can set a red-eye flight policy to allow your travelers one cabin class upgrade.\nimage.png\n \nLead Time\nLead time refers to how far in advance travel should be booked. Price and lead time are inherently linked for flights, and you will notice that prices will increase within 14 days of the flight departure date and as inventory decreases. \n\nTips and Recommendations:\n\nTripActions recommends a 14-day lead time for flights to drive booking behavior, resulting in the most flight savings. This number should be balanced with business demands and traveler booking habits to ensure that your policy is appropriate and effective. \n\nBooking Approval\nThere are two approval flows to choose from:\n\nSoft Out-of-Policy: Travel approvers will be notified via email when an out-of-policy booking is made by one of their travelers and will have the ability to cancel the traveler's booking. If no action is taken, the booking will remain confirmed.\nNo Approval Required: Travel approvers will not receive any notifications when travelers book outside their assigned policy.\nThere is the additional option to assign an Override Booking Approver for each policy group. This individual will be the default approver for all out-of-policy bookings or bookings above the set price threshold. \n\nTips and Recommendations\n\nTo provide increased visibility and control over traveler policy compliance, TripActions recommends a Soft Out-of-Policy approval flow.  \nAdding an override approver is appropriate for policy groups that require centralized oversight.

On your invite, you will see all of the booking types (flight, hotel, car, train) available to you, as well as the event title and any booking notes or recommendations.\n\nLocation and booking dates\nEach booking type will be pre-populated with the event location and dates. Your invite creator will have specified the dates that you are allowed to book; this may be before or after the actual invite/event dates in order to provide you with added flexibility.

    "body": "Hard Out-of-Policy Approvals in TripActions\nThe Hard Out-of-Policy approval configuration offers companies the option to automatically have travel bookings canceled if they are not actioned by a traveler's designated approver or a company admin. When a Hard Out-of-Policy approval flow is selected, approvers are notified of out-of-policy bookings and must choose to approve or decline them. Any out-of-policy booking that is not approved or declined within the cancelation window will be automatically canceled. \n\nNote: Hard approval options are not a part of the default policy configuration settings and must be enabled by your Customer Success Manager before they can be configured. \n \n\nSetting Policy Approvals in TripActions \nWhen enabled, a Hard Always policy can be applied by booking type through the Booking approval section of your travel policy configuration page.\n\nimage.png\n\nOverride Booking Approver\nAdmins have the ability to assign another user within their company to approve out-of-policy bookings by policy group. Assigning an Override Booking Approver will override any other designated approver and only the override approver will receive out-of-policy booking notifications. \n\n\nApproval Flow\nWhen a Hard Out-of-Policy approval option is selected, it will be applied to all users assigned to that policy. Designated approvers for these users will be notified via email each time one of their travelers makes a booking that violates their assigned policy. The email notification will include the time available to action the booking (based on the void window) and refund information. Within the email notification, the approver can click Approve or Decline to be directed to the Approvals tab of their Manager Dashboard. When declining a booking, the approver has the ability to type a reason for the cancelation that will be displayed to the traveler. If no action is taken within the allotted void/cancelation window, the booking will be automatically canceled.\n\nHard Out-of-Policy Approval Flow: \n\nimage.png\n \nCancelation/Void Windows\nHard approval cancelation windows function differently by booking type; see below for information about each.\n\nFlight Bookings: Travel approvers will have until the booking's void window to action a flight booking. Void windows are the time provided by an airline carrier to cancel a booking without penalty. Void windows vary by region and are based on a traveler's assigned point of sale.\nUnited States: Major airline carriers operating in a U.S. point of sale typically offer a void window of 24 business hours after a booking is made.\nEMEA and APAC: Major airline carriers operating in an EMEA and APAC point of sale typically offer a void window that extends to 11:59 p.m. of the day the ticket was booked. Therefore, a booking made at 4:00 p.m. will have an eight hour void window and must be approved or declined before 11:59 p.m. that same day.\nLow Cost Carriers and Instant Purchase Tickets: Low cost carriers and instant purchase tickets do not typically offer a void window; booking cancelation terms are unique to the provider and based on the ticket selected by the traveler. \nHotel Bookings: Travel approvers will have 24 hours to action the booking, however, refunds are determined by terms of the booking. Canceled hotel bookings that are marked as non-refundable or that are past the cancelation window will not be refunded. \nRental Car Bookings: Travel approvers will have 24 hours to action the booking, however, refunds are determined by the terms of the booking. Unless stated otherwise, rental car bookings are typically fully refundable.\n \nTraveler Experience\nTravelers can view their assigned policies from their TripActions search homepage by clicking on My [flight/hotel/train/rental car] policy. Out-of-policy booking options will be marked with a shield icon on the search results page, inventory details page (i.e. room details page on hotel bookings), and checkout page. Travelers can hover over the shield to see the reason that it is marked as out-of-policy. If booking out-of-policy, the traveler will be asked to provide a reason for the out-of-policy booking and be notified that their approver has the ability to reject the booking. This information will be available in the travel approver's out-of-policy email notification and on the Approvals dashboard.\n\nimage.png\n \nWhen a traveler assigned to a hard policy makes a booking, they will receive the following prompts based on the booking's cancelation terms:\n\nRefundable Bookings: After the traveler clicks Book now on the checkout page, a pop-up window will alert them that approval is required and that if not approved, the booking will be canceled and refunded. The traveler must then click Book now & request approval to proceed.\nimage.png\n \nNon-Refundable Bookings: After selecting a non-refundable booking option, a pop-up window will alert the traveler that if their approver declines the booking, the booking will be canceled and not refunded. After the traveler clicks Book now on the checkout page, a second pop-up window will alert them that approval is required and that if not approved, the booking will be canceled and not refunded. The traveler must then click Book now & request approval to proceed.\nimage.pngimage.png\n \nIf the traveler’s approver declines the booking, the traveler will get an email letting them know their booking has been declined and canceled along with the approver's reason. The traveler will have the opportunity to restart their search from the email. If the traveler’s approver approves the booking, the traveler will receive an email stating that their booking has been approved. Travelers can also check the status of their booking from their Trips page. \n\nimage.png\n \nGuest Bookings\nWhen an invite is created using the Invite Guest tool, the inviter will assign a company booking policy to the guest's invitation. During the guest's search process, the out-of-policy icon will display for all flight, hotel, car, and train bookings that are not in line with their assigned policy (such as exceeding the price maximum). If the guest is making a booking that is not in line with their assigned policy, they will be required to provide a reason on the checkout page.\n\nAll out-of-policy bookings will be sent to the policy approver; as a default, the person that created the invitation is the designated approver unless another user has been specified (this is either the TripActions Point of Contact listed in the invitation or an Override approver listed in your company's Guest policy). The designated approver will receive an email notification of the out-of-policy booking and will have the ability to action it through a link in the email or from their Manager Dashboard. For more information about your guest's booking experience on TripActions, view this article.\n \n\nNotifications\nIf a traveler's designated approver does not approve or decline a booking within the allotted time, the booking will be automatically canceled and the traveler will need to re-book their trip.

Note: If the cancelation window is less than 24 hours, the first notification will be addressed to the users listed in the '21 hours after booking' notification. \nEight hours after booking: The traveler's designated approver is notified that the booking has not been actioned\n21 hours after booking: The traveler's designated approver, the manager of the travel approver, and the traveler's manager are notified that the booking requires action before it is automatically declined and canceled.\n23 hours 50 minutes after booking/End of Cancelation Window: The booking is canceled and subject to any cancelation fees\nimage.pngimage.png\n \nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: A booking for a traveler assigned to hard approvals was made by an admin; why was no approval email sent? \nA: Admins do not have any enforced policy approvals. Therefore, if a company admin books on behalf of a colleague and books outside of their assigned policy, the out-of-policy flow will be overridden since the booker is a company admin with the ability to set company policies. Additionally, admins will not be prompted to provide out-of-policy booking reasons upon checkout. \n\nQ: How do hard approvals work for booking delegates? \nA: When delegates book for other travelers by logging in as them in TripActions, any bookings made will be subject to the policy assigned to that traveler (not the delegate's policy). If a delegate books for another traveler through their own profile, any bookings made will be subject to their own (the delegate's) assigned policy. \n\nQ: Are bookings made via Trip Proposal still subject to hard approvals?  \nA: Yes. Bookings made via trip proposal are still subject to the traveler's assigned policies and approval flow. ",

    "body": "Creating Travel Policies for Guests \nCompany admins can set a guest travel policy that can be applied to guests who are invited to book travel in TripActions via the Invite Guest feature. \n\nThere are two main steps to configuring your Guest Policy: \n\nSet your policy rules: Define booking parameters around items such as cost or booking lead time for each policy category (flights, hotels, trains, and rental cars)\nSet different levels of guest policy: Use the available policy levels to set specific policy rules for different types of guests \nRead below to learn more about each of these steps and how you can complete them in TripActions. \n\n\nSetting Policy Rules\nWithin your Guest Policy, you are able to set policy rules for different categories of travel (flights, hotels, trains, and rental cars). Similar to your employee travel policy, each category has unique configuration options like cost, booking lead time, highest cabin allowed, booking approval, and more.\n\nCost maximums\nFor companies with multiple points of sale, cost values can be set in the currency for each of your points of sale, if desired. Otherwise, currencies will be converted to match each user's point of sale. For example, if you set a price maximum of 200 USD for short haul flights, the spend maximum will be approximately 175 EUR for users who are assigned to a point of sale that transacts in EUR.\n\n\nDefining Policy Levels\nWhen creating your Guest Policy, you will have the option to use three different policy levels: Default, Director, and Executive*. These levels (regardless of their label) can be used to group your non-employee travelers into different buckets according to your company's needs. For example, you can use the 'Director' level to create a policy specific to consultants, or the 'Executive' level to create a policy for interview candidates. You will have the ability to use any or all of the available policy levels. These policy levels will be available under each booking category (flights, hotels, trains, and rental cars) so that you can easily configure policy rules specific to that category. \n\n*Customers who implemented TripActions prior to February 1, 2022 and created additional custom policy levels will have access to these levels in addition to Default, Director, and Executive options. Guest policy levels cannot be re-named or removed, and additional policy levels cannot be added.  \n \n\nGuest Policy Configuration Example \nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Policy > Guest policy\nClick on the bed icon from the menu on the left to access the Hotel policy configuration options\nUse the Policy level column under each configuration option (i.e. Cost) to indicate the type of guest this policy will apply to: \nSelect the Default policy level and click into the Policy column to set your booking rules\n[Optional] Select the Director and/or Executive level(s) to set additional rules for different types of guests \nScreen Shot 2022-02-07 at 3.49.54 PM.png\n\nInvite Creator and Guest Experience\nWhen a guest is invited to book travel in TripActions, the invite creator will have the ability to apply one of the guest policy levels configured under your Guest Policy. Alternatively, invite creators will have the option to create a custom policy for their guest. When guests are making their bookings, they will see any booking options that violate their assigned policy marked with an out-of-policy shield on the search results page. If guests proceed with an out-of-policy booking, the designated approver (the invite creator, invite point of contact if different from the creator, or guest booking override approver) will have the ability to cancel the booking and prompt the guest to re-book via a new invite. For a full overview of the guest's booking experience and policy considerations, see this article. \n\n ",

    "body": "Best Practices for Setting your Train Policies\nWhen setting a train policy, we encourage our customers to balance the desire for cost-control and visibility with a great booking and travel experience for employees. For insights into your company's booking habits and spend, we recommend that admins utilize data from the Analysis Dashboard. Read below to learn more about best practices for setting your policy. \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to configure and assign policies in your company's TripActions account, see this article. \n\n\nCost\nTrain policy allows you to set a maximum ticket price for your employees (this maximum will apply to single ticket and return ticket purchases). If you choose to set a maximum price, your travelers will see tickets priced above this maximum indicated with an out-of-policy shield icon. The maximum price should be left at $0 if you do not want to set a maximum for your travelers. \n\nTips & Recommendations: \n\nWe recommend only setting a maximum price policy for train bookings if your company has used TripActions to book train travel for at least three months; gain insights into average ticket costs through the Analysis Dashboard. In the absence of train travel spend data, we suggest leaving the maximum price at $0. \n\nHighest Cabin Allowed\nThe cabin classes you allow travelers should balance your company culture, travel budgets, and traveler safety and comfort. For train bookings, choose between allowing only Standard class cabin bookings or allowing bookings within First Class cabins. Pricing for each cabin will vary by carrier and route. Typically, first class cabins offer wider seats and more legroom and should be considered if your travelers frequently book long trips by train. \n\n\nLead Time\nPrice and lead time are inherently linked for train bookings, and you will notice that prices will increase once you are within 14 days of the train departure date and inventory decreases. \n \n\nTips & Recommendations:\n\nTripActions recommends a 14-day lead time for train bookings to drive booking behavior, resulting in the most savings. This number should be balanced with business demands and traveler booking habits to ensure that your policy is appropriate and effective. \n \nBooking Approval\nAt this time, approval flows are not available for train bookings. If a maximum price has been set, tickets priced above your policy maximum with be indicated by an out-of-policy shield on the search results page. However, out-of-policy bookings exceeding the maximum price can still be made, and the traveler's designated approver will not be notified. ",

    "body": "Best Practices for Setting your Car Rental Policies\nWhen setting a car rental policy, we encourage our customers to balance the desire for cost-control and visibility with a great booking and travel experience for employees. For insights into your company's booking habits and spend, we recommend that admins utilize data from the Analysis Dashboard. Read below to learn more about best practices for setting your policy. \n\nFor detailed instructions on how to configure and assign policies in your company's TripActions account, see this article. \n \n\nCost\nA dynamic policy is the best way to ensure your travelers are booking a reasonably priced car rental based on the dates and location of travel. Dynamic pricing works by evaluating all of the reasonable results and calculating a Price to Beat (fair market price) for the search. \n\nTips & Recommendations \n\nTo increase visibility into traveler spend and increase cost-control, use the dynamic policy to add a percentage cap over the fair market price. Any booking over the percentage cap will trigger an out-of-policy notification to the traveler's approver. We recommend choosing 20% to allow for some flexibility. \nIn addition to setting a dynamic policy, you can set a maximum price per night for hotels. We suggest relying solely on the dynamic policy and leaving the maximum price at $0. \nNote: If you have both a dynamic policy and a maximum price configured, the lower of the two values will be used as the price cap. For example, if you have a $40 price to beat with a 20% dynamic policy, and a $50 price cap, anything above $48 per day will be flagged as out of policy because the dynamic price with the additional 20% is less than $50.\n \n\nComfort\nWe recommend that companies with preferred rental car providers and discounted rates utilize the Classes allowed option. Contracts often name specific car classes eligible for discounted rates; we recommend setting your policies to match these classes so that travelers qualify for the discounted rates. Use the Custom option to specify which classes you want to allow for each policy group (i.e. Economy, Compact, Electric, Hybrid, Luxury, etc.). \n \n\nLead Time\nCar rental pricing is dependent on availability rather than lead time. We recommend leaving the lead time for car bookings at 0 days (Unlimited).   \n \n\nBooking Approval\nThere are two approval flows to choose from:\n\nSoft Out-of-Policy: Travel approvers will be notified via email when an out-of-policy booking is made by one of their travelers and will have the ability to cancel the traveler's booking. If no action is taken, the booking will remain confirmed.\nNo Approval Required: Travel approvers will not receive any notifications when travelers book outside their assigned policy. \nThere is the additional option to assign an Override Booking Approver for each policy group. This individual will be the default approver for all out-of-policy bookings or bookings above the set price threshold. \n\nTips & Recommendations\n\nTo provide increased visibility and control over traveler policy compliance, TripActions recommends a Soft Out-of-Policy approval flow.  \nAdding an override approver is appropriate for policy groups that require centralized oversight. This option is appropriate for companies that want high visibility into spending habits and out-of-policy bookings. \n \nIncreasing Savings with TripActions Rewards\nOur most successful customers utilize the TripActions Rewards Program to drive additional savings by incentivizing travelers to book cost-conscious hotels and cars. To learn more about how the TripActions Rewards Program increases savings, adoption, and traveler satisfaction, view this article. ",

Global settings include: \n\nDestination settings: Block travel to specific destinations, restrict travel only within a location, and/or allow only a specific group to travel to a location.\nHotel safety: Block travelers from seeing 2-star hotel inventory and/or block specific hotel locations.\nCost controls: Set route-specific flight price caps and/or location-specific hotel price caps; these settings override the general cost settings of your flight and hotel policies. \nPolicy document: Upload a copy of your company’s travel policy so that it is visible to your travelers. \nFor detailed definitions and instructions on how to configure each of the policy types above, click on each hyperlinked title. \n\n",

    "body": "Creating and Assigning Employee Travel Policies \nCreating your employee Travel Policy is one of the main components of setting comprehensive travel guidelines in TripActions. There are two main steps to configuring your Travel Policy:\n\nDetermining who your policy should apply to: Apply your policy to groups of users based on shared attributes (i.e. department or region) or to individual users\nSetting your policy rules: Set your rules for employee booking behavior (such as cost or booking lead time) for each policy category (flights, hotels, trains, rental cars, black cars, and Trip Proposals)\nRead below to learn more about the configuration options available to you as well as how to set your policy rules.\n \n\nConfiguration Options\nThe flights, hotels, trains, and car rental policy categories will each provide configuration options for cost (how much a traveler should spend based on a set maximum price or on TripActions Dynamic Pricing), lead time (how far in advance a traveler should book), and booking approval (when approval should be required for out-of-policy bookings).\n\nEach policy category will also have additional unique policy configuration options, specific to that category. For example, the flights policy category will provide options for setting rules based on how long a flight is (short, medium, or long-haul), while the hotel policy category will provide you with options to set rules around what types of rooms your employees should book (refundable only or all room types allowed).\n\nLastly, your policy will offer the option to enable Trip Proposals for your travelers. See this article for more information on the Trip Proposal option.\n\nExample of policy configuration options available for flights:\n\nimage.png\nExplore each policy category under the Travel policy section of your Admin Dashboard to get a full overview of the available configuration options.\n\n\nDetermining Policy Applicability \nYou can choose to apply your policies based on either of the below options: \n\nBy traveler attribute(s): Assign policies to groups of travelers according to their shared attributes (such as policy level, region, department, and more); select a primary attribute (i.e. Policy Level = Director), and an optional secondary attribute (i.e. Region = EMEA). All traveler attributes are configured on and obtained from the TripActions User List.\nBy individual: Assign policies to individual travelers based on their unique needs. Individual assignments will override assignments by attribute (i.e. if user Jane is assigned to an individual policy but also falls under the policy for the marketing department, Jane's individual policy will be applied when she books travel).\n\nExample Configuration by Attributes:\n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Policy > Travel policy\nSelect the category (i.e. Flights) you would like to set a policy for and then choose a configuration option (i.e. Cost).\nClick + Add policy rule for specific groups or users \nSelect a Primary attribute from the dropdown menu (i.e. Region = EMEA)\n[Optional] Select a Secondary attribute (i.e. Department = Sales)\nClick Save changes at the bottom of the screen\n\nImportant Note: Once a Primary Attribute and Secondary Attribute is chosen, all policy rules for that policy option (i.e Flight cost) will be configured by the same attribute. For example, if you are configuring your flight cost policy and you choose Region as a primary attribute, and Department as the secondary attribute, all subsequent policy rules for flight cost must be configured by Region and Department.\n\nimage.png\n\nExample Configuration by Individual:\n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Policy > Travel policy\nSelect the category (i.e. Flights) you would like to set a policy for and then choose a configuration option (i.e. Cost).\nClick + Add policy rule for specific groups or users \nBegin typing in the name of the traveler(s) under Assign travelers by name; you can add multiple travelers at once.\nClick Update \nClick Save changes at the bottom of the screen\nOnce the individual user(s) have been assigned to the policy, you will see them listed in the policy table as Individual users; click on Details to see assigned travelers.\nimage.png \n\nSetting Policy Rules\nNow that your policies have been applied to the correct users, you can set your policy rules. Policy rules will have unique configuration options according to the type of policy you are setting (i.e. Hotels versus Flights). See the Configuration Options section of this article for more context.\n \n\nPolicy Rules Configuration Example: Hotel Cost \n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Policy > Travel policy\nClick on the bed icon from the menu on the left to access the Hotel policy configuration options and scroll to the Cost section \nClick into the Policy column and set a Dynamic policy and/or enter a Max price per night. If values are entered for both, see this article for implications. \nClick Save changes; these rules will now apply to anyone assigned to this specific policy.\nimage.png\n \n\nResetting Policy Rules or Attributes\nYou can reset your policy rules or attributes at any time by clicking on the ellipsis menu (three dots) under any configuration option and selecting Reset attributes.\n  \n\nOther Considerations\nCost & Different Points of Sale (Currency)\nFor customers with multiple points of sale, cost values can be set in the currency for each of your points of sale if desired. Otherwise, currencies will be converted to match each user's point of sale. For example, if you set a price maximum of 200 USD for short flights, the spend maximum will be approximately 175 EUR for users on the EUR point of sale. \n\nFor customers who have implemented TripActions prior to February 1, 2022:\nPlease note that your policy groups will be automatically migrated over to the new policy assignment logic outlined in this article. Your migrated policy groups can be found under Policy level and will contain the same users as originally configured. Example: If you had previously configured a policy group that contains all of your Sales and Enablement employees, the policy group's name and users will remain the same, and can be found as a Policy level attribute. Policy levels cannot be changed, however, you can use User attributes as outlined above, to create policy rules based on primary and secondary attributes.",

    "body": "Changing a User's Email Address\nCompany admins can update a traveler's email address within the TripActions platform through a user list file upload. For instructions on how to edit information through a file upload, view this article. Before making changes to a traveler's email address, we advise the following to ensure that the changes are successful: \n\nEnsure that the user whose email address is being changed has an Employee ID in place prior to the change. This will serve as a unique identifier so that the new email address is associated with the correct profile. If your company does not use employee IDs, a fake ID (i.e. 12345) can be temporarily added for this purpose.\nEnsure that the new email address's domain (i.e. @company.com) has been added to your account. New domains can be added to your account by your Customer Success Manager. If the domain is already associated with your account, you can skip this step. \nIf your company is using a Single Sign On (SSO) authentication method, ensure that the user's new email address has also been changed with your SSO provider. \nIf your company is using an HRIS sync to manage your user list, email addresses will be automatically updated in the sync if the user's employee ID is the same in the HRIS and TripActions.\nChanges made to your user list will take effect immediately. If your traveler has multiple company accounts registered with TripActions and you would like to merge them into one, see this article for instructions. Note: This change must be made by a company admin; users are not able to change their email address from their account.\n\n",

To leverage this option, you will first need to create a Lyft business profile with the same email address you use in TripActions. Read below to learn more. \n\n\nCreating a Business Profile in Lyft\nLogin to your Lyft account and follow the steps outlined in this article.\nYou will be prompted to complete the following fields:\nWork email: Ensure that this is the same email address used in TripActions \nPayment method: This can be a personal card or a TripActions Liquid physical card\nReceipt forwarding: Choose TripActions Liquid as your expense option\nAfter creating your business profile in Lyft, no additional steps are required in TripActions and you can begin to automatically submit Lyft expenses. \n\n\nOrdering a Lyft and Submitting an Expense \nOrdering a Lyft\nAfter setting up your business profile in Lyft, each Lyft request will allow you to categorize the trip as Business or Personal; in order for TripActions to receive a copy of your Lyft receipt, you must categorize the trip as Business. This ensures that receipts are automatically sent to TripActions and is the key differentiator between the receipts we receive and those we do not.                                     \n\nSubmitting an expense\nAfter requesting a Lyft, you will receive a push notification that your rideshare expense has been attached to a new transaction. An expense draft will be created and stored in the Drafts folder of the mobile app. After your Lyft ride is completed, you will receive a second push notification informing you that your expense has been submitted. After submission, the expense will no longer be in your Drafts folder and can be found under the My transactions section. Note: To receive push notifications, they must be turned on under your device settings.\n\nAdding a receipt\nAfter an expense is submitted, a final receipt will not be attached to the transaction until the trip is marked as complete through Lyft; this may include after a tip is added, after the trip is given a rating, or after Lyft processes the payment. A copy of the final receipt will automatically be sent to TripActions and added to the submitted expense.\n \n\nEditing a Transaction\nTransaction drafts\nIn the event of an information matching or upload error that causes your transaction to not submit automatically, you can manually edit and submit it in the TripActions Liquid mobile app. To do so, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to the My transactions > Drafts \nTap on the transaction draft.\nMake any necessary edits and submit the transaction.\n\nApproved expenses\nIf your Lyft expense has already been submitted and approved, the transaction details can no longer be modified. If you need to modify an approved expense, contact your account admin. \n\n\nPolicy Considerations\nLyft rideshare transactions charged to a TripActions Liquid card that are within your assigned policy will be automatically approved and require no further action. Rideshare transactions charged to a personal card that are within your assigned policy will be automatically reimbursed. To view your assigned policy for rideshare expenses, navigate to Policy > On-trip expenses > Traveling: taxi & rideshare in the TripActions Liquid mobile app. ",

    "body": "Flight and Hotel Reshopping\nReshopping (also known as price assurance) monitors your existing global flight and hotel bookings and automatically rebooks your reservation when a lower rate is found for the same booking. Currently, TripActions partners with FairFly  for airfare reshopping and TripBAM for hotel reshopping. \n\n\nHow it Works \nIf your company has enrolled in either or both reshopping services, your flights and hotels will be reshopped automatically. Each time you make a flight or hotel booking in TripActions, the reshopping algorithm gets to work and starts continuously scanning various inventory sources for price drops. If a lower price for your original booking is found within the booking's cancelation/void window, your original booking will be automatically cancelled and rebooked at a lower price. \n\nWhen a flight booking is reshopped...\nYou get to stay on the same plane, in the same cabin, in the same plane seat, and receive the same airline rewards. \n\nWhen a hotel booking is reshopped...\nYou get to stay in the same hotel, receive the same hotel loyalty points, and keep the same amount of TripActions Rewards earned on the original booking. While the reshopping experience will always attempt to place you in a room type that is the same or similar to your original booking, some variation may occur. Additionally, there may be changes to the amenities included in your original booking. Any changes will be clearly outlined in an email notification. \n\n\nReshopping Notifications\nYou will receive a notification each time you make a flight or hotel booking letting you know that your booking may be reshopped if a lower price is found. Additionally, you will receive a confirmation email if reshopping takes place, informing you that your booking has been reshopped, outlining any associated changes, and providing a summary of savings for your company.

    "body": "Creating & Assigning Employee Travel Policies\nNote: This is a new limited release feature currently only available to specific TripActions customers. For documentation on the existing policy setup feature in TripActions, see this article.\nCreating your employee Travel Policy is one of the main components of setting comprehensive travel guidelines in TripActions. There are two main steps to configuring your Travel Policy:\nDetermining who your policy should apply to: Apply your policy to groups of users based on shared attributes (i.e. department or region) or to individual users\nSetting your policy rules: Set your rules for employee booking behavior (such as cost or booking lead time) for each policy category (flights, hotels, trains, rental cars, black cars, and trip proposals)\nRead below to learn more about the configuration options available to you for each policy category as well as how to set your policy rules.\nConfiguration Options\nThe flights, hotel, train, and car rental policy categories will each provide configuration options for cost (how much a traveler should spend based on a set maximum price or on TripActions Dynamic Pricing), lead time (how far in advance a traveler should book), and booking approval (when approval should be required for out-of-policy bookings).\nEach policy category (i.e. flights) will also have additional unique policy configuration options, specific to that category type. For example, the flights policy category will provide options for setting rules based on how long a flight is (short, medium, or long-haul), while the hotel policy category will provide you with options to set rules around what types of rooms your employees should book (refundable only or all room types allowed).\nLastly, your policy will offer the option to enable Trip Proposals for your travelers. See this article for more information on the Trip Proposal option.\nExplore each policy category under the Travel Policy section of your Admin Dashboard to get a full overview of the available configuration options.\nExample of policy configuration options available for flights:\nApplying your Policy\nPolicy rules can be applied in two different ways:\nBy traveler attribute(s): Assign policies to groups of travelers according to their shared attributes. Select a primary attribute (i.e. policy level = director), and an optional secondary attribute (i.e. region = EMEA). All traveler attributes are configured on and obtained from the the TripActions User List.\nBy individual: Assign policies to individual travelers based on their unique needs. Individual assignments will override assignments by attribute (i.e. if user Jane is assigned to an individual policy but also falls under the policy for the marketing department, Jane's individual policy will be applied).\nExample Configuration by Attributes:\nNavigate to Admin Dashboard > Policy > Travel Policy\nSelect the category (i.e. flights) you would like to set a policy for and then choose a configuration option (i.e. cost)\nClick + Add policy rule for specific groups or users\nSelect a Primary attribute from the dropdown menu (i.e region = EMEA)\n[Optional] Select a Secondary attribute (i.e. department = Sales)\nClick Save changes at the bottom of the screen\nImportant Note: Once a Primary Attribute and Secondary Attribute is chosen, all policy rules for that policy option (i.e flight cost) will be configured by the same attribute. For example, if you are configuring your flight cost policy and you choose Region as a primary attribute, and Department as the secondary attribute, all subsequent policy rules for flight cost must be configured by Region and Department.\nExample Configuration by Individual:\nNavigate to Admin Dashboard > Policy > Travel Policy\nSelect the category (i.e. flights) you would like to set a policy for and then choose a configuration option (i.e. cost)\nClick + Add policy rule for specific groups or users\nBegin typing in the name of the traveler(s) under Assign travelers by name; you can add multiple travelers at once\nClick Save changes at the bottom of the screen\nOnce the individual user(s) have been assigned to the policy, you will see them listed in the policy table as Individual users; click on Details to see assigned travelers\nCreating Policy Rules\nNow that your policies have been applied to the correct users, you can configure your policy rules. Policy rules will have unique configuration options according to the type of policy you are setting (i.e. Hotels versus Flights). See the Configuration Options section of this article for more context.\nPolicy Rules Configuration Example: Hotel Cost\nNavigate to Admin Dashboard > Policy > Travel Policy\nClick on the bed icon from the menu on the left to access the Hotel policy configuration options and scroll to this Cost section\nClick into the Policy column and set a Dynamic policy and/or enter a Max price per night. If values are entered for both, see this article for implications.\nClick Save changes; these rules will now apply to anyone assigned to this specific policy\nResetting Policy Rules or Attributes\nYou can reset your policy rules or attributes at any time by clicking on the ellipsis (three dot) menu under any configuration option and selecting Reset attributes.\nOther Considerations\nCost & Different Points of Sale (Currency)\nFor customers with multiple points of sale, cost values can be set in the currency for each of your points of sale if desired. Otherwise, currencies will be converted to match each user's point of sale. For example, if you set a price maximum of 200 USD for short haul flights, the spend maximum will be approximately 175 EUR for users on the EUR point of sale.\nFor customers who have implemented TripActions prior to February 1, 2022:\nPlease note that your policy groups will be automatically migrated over to the new policy assignment logic outlined in this article. Your migrated policy groups can be found under Policy level and will contain the same users as originally configured.\nFor example...\nIf you had previously configured a policy group that contains all of your Sales and Enablement employees, the policy group's name and users will remain the same, and can be found as a Policy level attribute. Policy levels cannot be changed, however, you can use User attributes as outlined above, to create policy rules based on primary and secondary attributes.",

To override the default approver and delegate approvals to another user, admins can set override approvers under any of the following travel policies: flights (short, medium, and long-haul), hotels, and rental cars. Additionally, admins can elect to override the default booking approver only for bookings above a certain spend threshold. \n\nGuests invited to book travel in TripActions will have a default policy approver of either the invite creator or the Point of Contact listed in the invitation, unless an override approver is assigned in the Guest Policy.

Once the booking is made, an email will be sent to the override approver, letting them know that the booking requires their attention. Approvers can action on the booking directly from the email or by visiting the Approvals tab of the Manager Dashboard.

    "body": "Hotel Reshopping via TripBAM\nHotel reshopping allows companies to earn additional savings on hotel bookings by leveraging price volatility and automatically rebooking lower rates during the cancelation window. To facilitate hotel reshopping on the TripActions platform, we've partnered with TripBAM. Continue reading to learn more about how hotel reshopping works and how you can enroll your company. \n\n\nHow it Works\nOnce one of your travelers books a hotel in TripActions, the TripBAM algorithm gets to work and starts continuously scanning the hotel's rate fluctuations so that bookings can be automatically canceled and rebooked at a lower price. When a hotel is reshopped, the traveler gets to stay in the same hotel, receive the same loyalty points, and keep the same amount of TripActions Rewards earned on the original booking. While the reshopping experience will always attempt to place the traveler in a room type that is the same or similar to their original booking, some variation may occur. Additionally, there may be changes to the amenities included in the original booking. \n\nWhen their company enrolls in hotel reshopping, travelers will receive a notification each time they make a hotel booking letting them know that their booking may be reshopped if a lower price is found. Additionally, travelers will receive a confirmation email if reshopping takes place, informing them that their booking has been reshopped, outlining any associated changes to the booking, and providing a summary of savings for their company.\n\nCompany admins will receive savings data directly from TripBAM and can access a complete list of reshopped hotels by running a booking report in TripActions. \n\n\nHow to Enroll your Company \nHotel reshopping is available to TripActions customers with a total annualized hotel spend of $2.5 million or above. If your company is interested in leveraging hotel reshopping, contact your Customer Success Manager. Your Customer Success Manager will work with you to confirm your annual hotel spend, understand your needs, and connect you with a member of the TripBAM team. TripBAM will meet with you to implement a service contract, review fees, and design your company's reshopping configuration.",

Once this has been completed, you will work with your Customer Success Manager to assign your desired (USD, GBP, or EUR) currency for each of your legal entities.\n\n\nExpense Policy Thresholds \nWhen setting your expense policies, you will apply spend thresholds, decline limits, and receipt threshold requirements for each of your enabled expense categories. These thresholds will be then be applied to employees based on their assigned legal entity (i.e. employees assigned to a legal entity with a currency of EUR will see thresholds in EUR, whereas those belonging to a legal entity with USD will see thresholds in USD). If you are a new customer or are adding additional currencies for the first time, you will select a currency to use for converting your additional currency thresholds. \n\nExample:\nIf you choose to use USD as your currency to convert from, and are also adding issuing currencies in GBP and EUR, USD will be used to establish (convert) the GBP and EUR thresholds as seen below: \n\nScreen Shot 2021-12-07 at 3.26.30 PM.png\nPlease note that no conversions will take place automatically after your initial set-up; if you would like to modify your thresholds, you can do so manually at any time by navigating to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy. For more information on setting expense policies, see this article. \n\n\n\nPurchase Card Approval Thresholds\nPurchase card approval thresholds define when an admin needs to approve a purchase card request versus the approval being provided by the employee's manager. Purchase cards will be associated to a legal entity at the time of creation, and the approval threshold will apply in the currency of the assigned legal entity. These thresholds can be modified at any time by navigating to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy.\n\nExample: \nIf a purchase card is requested by an employee assigned to a legal entity with a EUR currency, the EUR approval threshold will apply to determine if the request should be approved by a manager or admin. \n\nScreen Shot 2021-12-07 at 3.36.30 PM.png\n\nSimilarly to expense policy thresholds, initial currency conversions will be provided at the time of set-up but will not automatically update; manual updates to approval thresholds can be made at any time by navigating to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy. For more information on configuring a policy for purchase card requests, see this article. ",

    "body": "TripActions Liquid™ Cards and Issuing Currencies \nTripActions Liquid™ physical and virtual cards can be issued in USD, GBP, and EUR currencies. The issuing currency for a card is determined by the following:\n\nWhat office a cardholder is assigned to (configured on the TripActions user list and \nWhat legal entity that office belongs to (configured via the Admin Dashboard on the core TripActions account) and \nWhat issuing currency has been assigned to that legal entity (determined by your company during initial account set-up and configured by the TripActions team. Existing entities and their currencies can be viewed under Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Settings > Legal Entities). \nFor more information on how to configure the above, see this article. Once these items are properly configured, new cards will be automatically issued in the user's corresponding currency. For more information on currencies outside of USD, GBP, or EUR as well as how to change the issuing currency for a card or legal entity, read below. \n\n\nEntities with Other Currencies (Non-USD, GBP, or EUR) \nEntities with locations where USD, GBP, or EUR is not the local currency will need to be assigned one of the three available issuing currencies. In these instances, users will still be able to use TripActions Liquid to make purchases in their local currency wherever Visa is accepted, however, transactions will be automatically converted and settle in the card's issuing currency (conversion fees will not be charged to customers). \n\n\nChanging Issuing Currencies \nFor a specific user/card \nIf you would like to change the issuing currency for a user's physical TripActions Liquid card, you will first need to ensure that you have made the corresponding change to their legal entity on the TripActions user list. Once this has been done, the user will automatically receive a push notifications in their TripActions Liquid app prompting them to replace their existing physical card. Once the new card is activated, the old card will automatically be deactivated. \n\nFor a legal entity\nIf you would like to change the default currency for one of your legal entities, please contact your Customer Success Manager. Once the change has been made, all users assigned to that legal entity will automatically be sent an email notification to order a replacement card to be issued in the new currency. \n\nFor more information on the user process of ordering a replacement card, see this article. \n\n\nVirtual Cards for Travel Purchases \nIssuing currency for virtual cards used to book travel on the TripActions platform will also be automatically determined by the user's assigned legal entity. Travel purchased on a virtual card from a point of sale with a currency different than the card's issuing currency will settle in the currency of the card, not the currency of the point of sale. For example, if a user is on a France point of sale which operates in EUR and purchases a flight with a virtual card issued in USD, the transaction will settle in USD, not in EUR. \n\n\nPurchase Cards \nTripActions Liquid purchase cards allow admins to select a legal entity when creating a new card. As with physical cards, the legal entity will determine the card's issuing currency. Cards issued in one currency can be used for purchases in another currency*, however, transactions will be automatically converted and settle in the card's issuing currency (conversion fees will not be charged to customers). \n\n*While purchase cards can typically be used on points of sale (websites) charging in a currency outside of what the card has been issued in, there may be instances where these transactions are flagged as potential fraud. We advise our customers to spend on websites that transact in same currency that their cards have been issued in whenever possible, or to use a local form of payment as needed. ",

    "body": "TripActions Booking ID\nEach booking made through TripActions will have a TripActions Booking ID. This number can be found on your booking confirmation email and on the booking itinerary within your Trips page. The TripActions Booking ID (separate from a provider specific confirmation number such as a hotel confirmation), represents a Passenger Name Record (PNR). PNRs are created when a booking is made and are used throughout the travel industry by online booking agents, travel management companies, hotels, airlines, and other inventory providers. The number contains trip details such as payment information, travelers on the booking, traveler preferences, loyalty information, and other information associated with the booking. PNRs also allow travel providers to exchange pertinent travel information so that you have a seamless experience when changing from one provider to another (i.e. a flight change that includes different airline carriers). When booking through TripActions, you will notice a separate PNR for each booking type in your trip (i.e. a different TripActions Booking ID for your flight, hotel, etc). \n\nimage (1).png\n \n\nBooking IDs (PNRs) with Multiple Travelers\nBusiness Bookings\nWhen multiple travelers are present on a business trip (booked via the Business tab of the TripActions search page), each traveler will be issued a separate Booking ID for each portion of the booking. For example, if a flight and hotel are booked for a traveler and their guest or a coworker, the traveler and guest/coworker will each receive a separate Booking ID for the flight and hotel, for a total of four unique Booking IDs. For information about how to add a guest to your booking, view this article. \n\nPersonal Bookings\nWhen multiple travelers are present on a personal trip (booked via the Personal tab of the TripActions search page), each traveler will be issued the same Booking IDs for each portion of the booking. For example, if a flight and hotel are booked for a traveler and their family or friend, the traveler and guest will be issued the same Booking ID for the flight and hotel, for a total of two unique Booking IDs. Personal travel functions differently than business travel on TripActions because there are multiple benefits to having your travel companions on the same Booking ID. These benefits include:  \n\nAirline Status Benefits: If you are booking on behalf of a personal guest and have an elite airline status and your guest does not, a shared Booking ID allows all travelers to benefit from the elite status (i.e. companion upgrades).\nFlight Change Convenience: If you wish to make changes to a flight, you will be able to alter all tickets with the same Booking ID at once, rather than needing to make multiple individual changes. This also means that if an airline begins changing tickets and seat assignments, they will know to keep all travelers under the same Booking ID together.\n\nFor information about how to add a family or friend to your booking, view this article.

A common use case for itemization is hotel expenses, where certain charges are typically covered by the company (i.e., the hotel's nightly rate or parking cost) while others should be covered by the employee (i.e., spa services utilized at the hotel). \n\nWhile your employees will have access to itemizing their own transactions, TripActions Liquid also allows admins to itemize a transaction on an employee's behalf after it has been submitted as a manual expense or charged to a TripActions Liquid card. Read below to learn how. \n\n\nItemizing a Transaction [non-lodging expense types]: \nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Activity\nFind and click on the transaction you would like to itemize and scroll to the Itemization section.\nSelect Itemize transaction and click Add Item to begin itemizing.\nFill out the fields for each item as prompted and click Done. \nSelect Add new item to continue itemizing as needed.\nimage.png\n \nItemizing a Transaction [lodging expense types]\nOnce you select Lodging as the Expense type while itemizing a transaction, you will be prompted to fill out additional fields (in addition to all of the itemization fields included in the previous section of this article). These fields include the date(s) of the hotel stay and the option to select whether you would like to enter the total for all nights or a nightly rate, depending on how you would like to itemize the transaction. Selecting a total for all nights will create a single item for the cost to stay at the hotel, whereas selecting a nightly rate will create separate items for each night's stay. In the example below, a nightly rate has been selected to itemize the transaction into two separate line items for each night's stay, as well as a separate line item for a spa service utilized by the traveler at the hotel. \n\n\nActioning or Editing an Itemized Transaction \nOnce a transaction has been itemized (either by the employee or by the admin), admins can make edits to the itemization as desired, at any time, by selecting the transaction and clicking Edit itemization.

    "body": "Auto-itemization via TripActions Liquid™\nTripActions Liquid provides you with the ability to automatically split a single transaction into multiple items, allowing for the assignment of expense types, GL codes, custom fields, and the approval or rejection of the transaction by your company admin on a per-item basis. A common use case for itemization is hotel expenses, where certain charges should be covered by your company (i.e. the hotel's nightly rate or parking cost) while others should be covered with your personal funds (i.e. spa services utilized at the hotel). \n\n\nWho can itemize a transaction and at what point? \nUsers can itemize their own manual transactions...\n\nAt any time before they have been submitted or after submission only if a transaction has been flagged for review by the company admin and has not yet been actioned by them. \nUsers can itemize their own transactions charged to a physical TripActions Liquid card...\n\n​​​​Only if the transaction has not been automatically approved upon being charged and has been flagged for review by the company admin, and before it has been actioned by the admin. \nCompany admins can itemize both manual transactions and transactions charged to a physical TripActions Liquid after they have been submitted/charged. \n\nRead below to find out how you can itemize your own transactions as a user. Note: Users can itemize transactions on the TripActions Liquid mobile app, however, the feature is not currently available on the web app. If you are a company admin and would like to learn how you can itemize transactions on your users' behalf, refer to this article.\n\n\nHow to itemize transactions as a user\nItemizing a manual transaction during expense submission [non-lodging expense types]: \n\nBegin the process of submitting a manual transaction as outlined in this article.\nOnce you reach the receipt upload portion, use the receipt scanner to auto-fill your transaction details. The scanner will fill in as much information as can be recognized on the receipt; any information not recognized will need to be input manually. The receipt scanner will also automatically create a separate line item for each item listed on the receipt.\nNote: While your company policy may not require you to upload receipts for some of your transactions, we recommend always uploading receipts on transactions you intend to itemize. Without a receipt, you will need to manually itemize the transaction by entering in each line item. \nOnce your transaction details have been input, tap Itemize. \nYou will be taken to the Manage items page where you can add details for each item as prompted, change the expense type if needed, delete an item, or mark an item as a personal expense to remove it from the portion to be submitted for reimbursement. \nTo itemize further, select Add item or tap Save to finish and submit your transaction. \nimage.png\n \nItemizing a manual transaction during expense submission [lodging expense type]: \nThe process for itemizing a manual transaction for lodging expenses will remain the same as outlined above, but you will be prompted to fill out several additional fields for the transaction including hotel check-in and check-out dates, cost of stay, and nightly rate. \n\nItemizing a manual transaction after expense submission: \nManual transactions will be automatically approved once submitted if they fall within the parameters of your assigned expense policy and cannot be itemized once approved (unless done by an admin). However, if a submitted non-itemized manual transaction has been flagged for review by your company admin for being non-compliant with your assigned expense policy, you will have the opportunity to itemize it if desired before it has been actioned by the admin. To do so: \n\nTap the In review tile on the homepage of your TripActions Liquid mobile app. \nLocate the transaction you would like to itemize. \nSelect Itemize and follow the same steps outlined in the Itemizing Manual Transactions sections of this article. \nYou can continue to Edit the itemization for the transaction until it is actioned (approved or rejected) by your company admin. \nItemizing a physical card transaction \nPhysical card transactions are automatically approved if they fall within the parameters of your assigned expense policy and cannot be itemized once approved. If a physical card transaction has been flagged for review by your company admin for being non-compliant with your assigned expense policy, you will have the opportunity to itemize it before it has been actioned (approved and rejected). To do so: \n\nTap the In review tile on the homepage of your TripActions Liquid mobile app. \nLocate the transaction you would like to itemize. \nSelect Itemize and follow the same steps outlined in the Itemizing Manual Transactions sections of this article.  \nYou can continue to Edit the itemization for the transaction until it is actioned (approved or rejected) by your company admin",

    "body": "Marking Hotels as Preferred in TripActions\nThe preferred hotel feature allows TripActions admins to mark specific hotel properties as company preferred. Once hotels have been marked as preferred, travelers will see a Company Preferred badge next to these properties in their hotel search results. Continue reading for recommendations on selecting your preferred hotels, how to enable, and the traveler experience.\nNote: Hotels marked as preferred simply reflect the booking preferences of your company; they do not require or indicate that you have a corporate negotiated rate in place with these properties and do not effect what search results are displayed to the traveler or the order of those results.\nRecommendations for Selecting Preferred Hotels\nListed below are common scenarios for marking a hotel property as preferred:\nYour travelers in a specific region have recommended properties that are known to be safe, have access to important amenities, and/or are centrally located.\nYour company has a chain-wide discount with a hotel and would like to highlight a specific property that is close to a workspace.\nYou are familiar with the hotel and know that the customer service or hotel amenities meet your travelers' expectations.\nThe company would like to build booking volume with a specific property in order to negotiate a corporate discounted rate in the future.\nIf you are interested in which cities and hotel locations your travelers book most often, you can view this data in your Admin Dashboard. Check out this article to learn more.\nAdding a Preferred Hotel Location(s)\nParameters\nCompanies can select a maximum of fifty preferred hotels globally\nPreferred hotels may be selected for a maximum of ten cities\nA maximum of five hotel properties can be marked as preferred within the same city\nPreferred badges are specific to a single hotel property and cannot be applied chain-wide\nHow to Add\nIf you are interested in adding preferred hotel badges, email a spreadsheet with the below information to your Customer Success Manager. Once loaded, your preferred badges will be displayed in each of your traveler's search results globally.\nTraveler Experience\nAfter running a hotel search, travelers will see the company's preferred hotel properties marked with a green [Company Name] Preferred badge. Travelers can also use the Special Rates Filter to view properties marked as company preferred. Hotels marked as preferred will not effect what search results are displayed to the traveler or the order of those results.\nIf a property has been marked as preferred and your company also has a corporate negotiated rate in place with the same property, the preferred badge will supersede the negotiated rate badge. Both designations will be reflected in the filtered results, however only the preferred badge will be displayed.",

    "body": "Booking Travel via a Team Travel Invite\nThe TripActions Team Travel feature allows your company to easily organize group travel for employees by leveraging self-serve tools built into the TripActions platform. If you have been invited to book travel for a team event through TripActions Team Travel, you will be able to view event details, make a booking, and see relevant event updates directly in your TripActions account. Read below to get started. \n\n\nYour Event Invitation\nWhen you are invited to a team event, you will receive an email invitation with the event date, location, and any additional notes provided by the event organizer. Click Book your trip to be directed to your TripActions Invitations page or simply login to TripActions at any time to view your invitation and begin booking.\n\nimage.png\n \n\nBooking Your Trip\nViewing Your Invitations\nEach time you login to TripActions, you will be directed to your event invitation.

Click Invitations to view all of the events that you have been invited to and to make a booking.\n\nimage.png\n\n\nBooking Types\nUpon creating an event, the event organizer will select which booking types you will need for the trip, such as a flight, hotel, car, and/or train. Under the event invitation in TripActions, you will see a separate tab for each booking type available to you with the event location and dates pre-populated. Click through each tab to search for your desired booking and make your selection(s). For instructions on how to book travel within TripActions, view this article.\n\nTip: Click on the Know before you go link on your booking homepage to view current travel requirements and restrictions. \n\nBooking Dates\nYour invitation booking page will have your travel dates and destination information pre-populated based on the event information entered by the event organizer.

If the organizer for your event updates notes or recommendations, these updates will be reflected on your event invitation page right away. \n\nBringing a Guest\nIf your invite allows you to book for yourself and an extra guest, you will see the option to Add one extra guest listed in the Travelers section of the booking search page. Your guest can be someone from inside or outside of your company; to add an external guest to your booking, create a profile for them by clicking + New user under Travelers. Once their profile is complete, simply add their name to the Travelers section and proceed with making the booking for both of you. \n\nimage.png\n\nPolicy and Approvals\nYou are able to book your event travel in accordance with the existing booking policies assigned to you by your company's account admin. In the instance that you make an out-of-policy booking, the event organizer will be notified and have the ability to cancel the booking and prompt you to re-book. You can view your assigned policy on the search homepage by clicking My [Flight, Hotel, Car, Train] Policy.\n\nTrip Name and Trip Fee\nA Trip with the event's name is automatically created once you make your first booking for the event and will display on your Trips page. After the first item in your trip is booked (i.e. flight), any additional items booked (i.e. hotel), will be added to the trip that has already been created. Trip fees are assessed to each traveler so both the invitee and guest will be charged a trip fee.\n\nPayment\nAs with all business trips booked on TripActions, payment for team travel will default to whatever payment methods have been made available to you in TripActions by your company's account admin. \n\n\nViewing and Modifying Your Trip\nOnce a booking has been made, you can view your itinerary under the Trips section of your account. The Trips page will display all cancelation information, and allow you to make changes using our self-serve change tools.\n\nIf your event organizer chooses to cancel the event, you will be notified via email. Please note that a canceled event does not automatically cancel your bookings; visit your Trips page to cancel your bookings. \n \n\nimage.png\n \nDeclining an Invite\nIf you will not be participating in the event you were invited to or have booked alternative travel/accommodations, you can Decline the invite through your original invitation email or by selecting an event from the Invitations tab on the main TripActions booking homepage. If an invite is declined, the event organizer will be notified via email. You can also select I'm done booking if you have completed your booking outside of the event invitation.\n\nNote: If you have already made bookings for the team event, declining the invite will not cancel the bookings. You will need to ensure that they are canceled via your Trips page or by contacting the TripActions Travel Experience Team. \n \n\nScreen Shot 2022-03-18 at 5.43.14 PM.png\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can I earn TripActions Rewards when booking Team Travel?\nA: Yes, if rewards have been made available to you for business travel bookings, rewards will display when booking a car or hotel via Team Travel. \n\nQ: Is there a window of time that I have to book a team invite? Do invitations expire?\nA: Team event invitations do not have a mandated booking period but invitees are obliged to follow their assigned booking policy guidelines. For example, if your flight policy mandates that all flights should be booked seven days in advance and you book a flight six days in advance, the booking will be marked as out-of-policy. Additionally, a booking invitation will expire once the dates for the team event are in the past.\n\nQ: I booked a part of my event outside of the event invitation; is there a way for me to merge the two trips together?\nA: At this time, a trip booked outside of a team event cannot be merged into a Team Travel trip and the two trips will remain separate on your Trips page.",

    "body": "Travel Payment through Airline Issued UATP Cards\nUATP, or Universal Air Travel Plan, is a global corporate travel payment solution owned and operated by the world’s airlines. UATP cards can be issued by airlines in the form of a credit card, United PassPlus or Priority Plus card, or prepaid card (cards funded with banked airline credits) and are leveraged by many organizations as a centralized company payment method for travel. \n\nExisting customers with admin access can load airline-issued UATP credit cards as a company payment for their company in the TripActions platform by following the steps outlined below. Customers looking to load a PassPlus or Priority Plus UATP card as a company payment method should contact their TripActions Customer Success Manager. \n \n\nAdding a UATP Card as a Company Payment Method \nClick Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Settings > Overview \nIn the section labeled Travel Payment Methods, click + Add new card\nEnter a card Nickname that will be visible to your travelers on the checkout page\nEnter the Card number\nUATP card numbers are 15 digits long and do not have a CVC\nOnce your UATP card number has been entered, TripActions will automatically recognize the form of payment as a UATP card\nOnce a UATP card has been detected, the Issuer/Airline field will appear. This field ensures that we present the UATP card as a form of payment when a traveler is purchasing a flight on the matching airline (i.e. a Lufthansa issued UATP card will display for a traveler who selects a Lufthansa flight but not for any other airline's inventory)\nBegin typing the airline name and select from the airline issuer from the drop-down menu\nIf you do not see the Issuer/Airline field appear, please confirm that the UATP card number was entered correctly\nIn the Back-up and fees payment field, select a form of payment for trip fees  \nAirline issued UATP cards can only be used to pay for airfare and cannot be used to pay for your travelers' trip fees; to cover the cost of trip fees in instances where your travelers are booking air travel on the TripActions platform with a UATP card, you will need to select or enter in an additional company payment method. \nUnder Card usage permissions, you can limit card use to a specific Department, Cost Center, Region, and/or Subsidiary as desired. You may also leave this as is, which will make the card available for all users in your company.\nNote: If you need to assign the card to more than one Department, Cost Center, Region or Subsidiary, you can do so by adding the same card multiple times. For example, if you want to add the same corporate card for your users in the USA and in Canada, you would enter the card information and select the USA region, and then enter the card information again and select the Canada region. \nSelect Flights under What types of bookings can the card be used for and mark the card as Available\nSee the next section in this article for more information about UATP card availability logic\nSelect whether you would like the card to be available for Guest Invites\nCurrently, guest invites can only have one form of payment attached to all bookings so we do not recommend having this form of payment available for guest invites. This means that if a guest books a flight outside of the UATP airline provider, no other form of payment will appear. \nClick Save to finalize \n \n\nMarking Airline Issued UATP Cards as Available vs. Mandatory\nAny credit card or UATP card marked as Prioritized (mandatory) will restrict use to only that payment method and other forms of payment will not be presented to the traveler. Therefore, if you are using both a company credit card and a UATP card, we recommend marking them both as Available. This ensures that UATP cards will always be presented as the form of payment when your travelers select flights on a matching airline. Airline issued UATP cards should NOT be marked as Prioritized for flight bookings since they cannot be used for non-matching flight inventory and marking them as prioritized will prohibit the use of any other payment method (company provided or traveler entered). To learn more about payment method settings, view this article.  \n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions \nQ: Can an AirPlus UATP card be loaded into TripActions? \nA: At this time, TripActions does not support AirPlus issued UATP cards. \n\nQ: Who is responsible for charging UATP credit cards?\nA: The airline inventory supplier charges UATP credit cards. TripActions does not charge the card.\n\nQ: If an airline-issued UATP card(s) is available, what cards will be presented on the checkout page in case of multi-airline bookings?\nA: At this time, no UATP card will be presented to the traveler on the checkout page if a booking contains multiple airlines. \n\nQ: My travelers are reporting that they are unable to book flights with an available airline-issued UATP card. What should I do?\nA: Get in touch with the issuing airline provider to confirm that there are enough funds on the card to cover the cost of the flight(s) in question and that the expiration date for the card has been entered correctly under your card settings in TripActions. Because many airlines have extended the expiration date on their UATP cards due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the expiration date you originally entered into TripActions may have subsequently changed and require updating.

    "body": "Similar Expense (Merchant) Category Logic\nWhen configuring the policies for your TripActions Liquid™ expense categories, you will notice that both the Discretionary expenses and On-trip expense categories have several food and incidental related subcategories. These sub-categories are:\n\nMeals for myself\nTeam events and meals\nEntertaining\nAlthough these subcategories are similar, each one can be configured according to its own set of policy rules. When two or more of these similar subcategories are enabled under either Discretionary expenses or On-trip expenses, users assigned to both or all three of the policies associated with the subcategories will be able to purchase up to the Decline amount on each policy. Once the decline limit has been reached, TripActions Liquid will assume the user is no longer spending within that category and route them to the next respective category in order of how they are listed.\n\nFor example...\nLet's assume Company A has enabled and set policies for the following:\n\nOn-trip expenses: Meals for myself\nOn-trip expenses: Team events and meals\nCompany A has applied both of the above policies for all users in their Engineering Department and set the following Policy and Decline limits: \n\nScreen Shot 2021-07-26 at 6.30.56 PM.png\n \nIf a user in the engineering department spends more than $50 per day (the policy limit) for meals but less than $100 per day (the decline limit), their transactions will be flagged for review under the Traveling: Meals for myself policy. However, if the same user spends more than $100 per day (the decline limit), TripActions Liquid will assume they are no longer purchasing meals for themselves, and their transactions will now be subject to the rules of the Traveling: Team events and meals policy. \n\nNote: If you would like to be notified as soon as someone moves past the Traveling: Meals for myself policy, set your Traveling: Team events and meals Policy to the Decline amount for Traveling: Meals for myself.

    "body": "Expense Policy Categories in TripActions Liquid™\nExpense policy categories allow TripActions Liquid administrators the flexibility to define what their employees can spend by expense type, as well as how they can use specific aspects of the TripActions Liquid offering. Within TripActions Liquid, there are six main expense policy categories that can be enabled and defined: \n\nPayments & expensing\nTravel expenses (incurred outside of TripActions)\nOn-trip expenses\nDiscretionary expenses\nBenefits\nOn the job expenses\nEach of these six categories will have its own set of sub-categories; every sub-category will have the ability to be enabled as desired, and once enabled, can be assigned a policy that defines the spend parameters for that type of expense. See below for a breakdown of each category and its sub-categories. \n \n\nPayments & Expensing\nThe Payments & Expensing category allows admins to define how and when different types of TripActions Liquid cards and transaction types can be utilized by employees, as well as set fraud prevention limits. The sub-categories available under Payments & Expensing are: \n\nTripActions Liquid Physical Cards\n\nDefine card availability:\nAlways active cards can be used outside of when an employee is actively traveling.\nTrip-enabled cards will only be active the 24 hours prior to the start of a trip and the 24 hours following the trip (as defined by the travel dates within TripActions). Any charges made outside of this window will be auto-declined. \nDefine receipt requirements\nTripActions Liquid Purchase Cards\n\nDefine which users can request purchase cards. \nDefine your desired approval process for purchase card requests. \nSee this article for more information \nManually Added Transactions\n\nDefine when receipts are required for transactions imported from a user's linked personal card. \nDefine when receipts are required for transactions that have been uploaded via the receipt scanner or manually entered in by the user. \nSee this article for more information\nTripActions Bookings with Virtual Cards \n\nSet the policy to always require a receipt or to never require a receipt by choosing one of the below options:\nRequired for pay-later hotels: Receipts are required in order for an expense to be approved.\nNever required: Receipts are not needed for expense approval. The user will still have the ability to upload a receipt in order to provide additional context about the expense.\nDefine which users the receipt policy applies to. \nFraud Prevention Limit\n\nSet a Max total spend per month for the company\nSetting a Policy for the monthly amount will alert (flag) administrators when this amount has been reached. \nSetting a Decline for the monthly amount will stop all further transactions from occurring. \nTransaction Settings\n\nSet tax detail requirements\nDefine when employees are required to capture tax details such as VAT and GST.\nSee this article for more information \nNote: The IRS in the United States only requires proof of receipt for expenses over $75 when running an audit. We suggest capping your receipt minimum at the same amount to eliminate unnecessary scrutiny and review for admins. Additionally, physical card transactions include an automatically generated e-receipt for every transaction. \n \n\nTravel Expenses\nTravel expenses allow you to define spend thresholds for any travel-related expenses that are not purchased within the TripActions platform, including: \n\nAirfare & fees - Controls expense settings for air travel-related transactions incurred outside of TripActions (i.e. baggage fees, in-flight purchases).\nLodging - Controls expenses for hotel-related transactions incurred outside of TripActions (i.e. hotel rooms, room service).\nRental cars - Controls expenses for rental car-related transactions incurred outside of TripActions (i.e. rental car fees charged upon pick-up).\nTrain travel - Controls expenses for ground transportation-related transactions incurred outside of TripActions (i.e. commuter rail).\nBlack cars - Controls expenses for black car-related transactions incurred outside of TripActions.\nTripActions fees - Assign a GL code to all TripActions trip fees.\n \nOn-trip Expenses \nOn-trip expenses allow you to define spend thresholds for any expenses incurred by employees while traveling for business, including: \n\nTraveling: meals for myself - Controls expenses for the employee's individual meals while traveling (i.e. employees buying themselves lunch on a business trip).\nTraveling: team events & meals - Controls expenses for meals and meetings with internal groups (i.e. team dinners, team outings).\nPer diem - Controls daily meal allowance for traveling users.

    "body": "Configuring Your Expense Policies\nSetting the right expense policies for your company through TripActions Liquid grants finance teams the ability to control expenses, while providing employees with the appropriate spend flexibility. Once your expense policies have been configured, transactions made within policy will be automatically approved in real-time, eliminating the need for expense reports. Read below to learn more about how expense policies in TripActions Liquid work, and how you can configure them for your company. \n\n\nHow TripActions Liquid Expense Policies Work \nWhen a transaction is made at the point-of-sale with a physical TripActions Liquid card or submitted as a manual (out-of-pocket) expense, TripActions Liquid uses data received from the merchant, known as a Merchant Category Code (MCC), to determine what expense category and policy should be applied to the transaction. An MCC is a four-digit code chosen by the merchant and used by credit card companies to classify businesses into sectors; TripActions Liquid uses this code to understand the type of service or goods being sold. With that information, along with contextual information like trip details for travel booked in TripActions, TripActions Liquid is able to determine if the transaction should be automatically approved, flagged, or rejected based on the applicable configured policy. \n\nHere's an example: \n\nScreen Shot 2021-07-28 at 3.47.01 PM.png\nBefore Configuring your Policies\nPrior to configuring your expense policies in TripActions Liquid, you will want to ensure that you have completed the following steps:\n\nUpload your company's GL codes: Upload GL codes into your TripActions Liquid account so that they can be assigned to your employees' transactions. \nConfigure any desired custom fields: In addition to the available default transaction fields, TripActions Liquid administrators have the option to create up to three custom fields for users to complete on transactions made with a TripActions Liquid physical card or when submitting a manual expense for reimbursement. \nEnsure your user attributes are appropriately assigned: TripActions Liquid allows administrators to set policy rules according to their employees' (users) attributes, such as department, cost center, region, and more. This gives administrators the flexibility to assign policies based on their employees' unique spend needs. User attributes are configured in the main TripActions Admin Dashboard under Users and can be maintained manually or through your HRIS integration. \nOnce these steps have been completed, you are ready to begin creating expense policies for each of the expense categories available in TripActions Liquid. \n\n\nExpense Categories\nExpense categories allow TripActions Liquid administrators the flexibility to define what users can spend by expense type. Within TripActions Liquid, there are six main expense categories available: \n\nPayments & expensing: Defines monthly limits, card usage, and receipt requirements\nTravel expenses: Controls travel spend purchased outside of TripActions\nOn-trip expenses: Controls spend directly related to expenses while traveling\nDiscretionary expenses: Controls spend outside of traveling\nBenefits: Controls spend for certain health and wellness related costs\nOn the job expenses: Controls office and business-related expenses\nEach of these six categories will have its own set of sub-categories; every sub-category will have the ability to be assigned a policy that defines the spend parameters for that type of expense. \n\n\nEnabling/disabling categories\nAdministrators will have the ability to enable or disable any expense category: \n\nEnabled categories: Enabled categories allow spend on TripActions Liquid physical cards and manually submitted expenses within the defined limits (see next section). \nDisabled categories: Disabled categories will decline transactions on TripActions Liquid physical cards and will flag manually submitted expenses. Users will receive a warning that they should not submit manual expenses for expense categories that are disabled, but can still choose to proceed with submission. All submitted manual transactions within a disabled category will be flagged in the Activity tab for TripActions Liquid administrators to approve, reject, or request more information. \n\nSetting category spend limits (policy rules)\nEach expense category will provide the ability for administrators to set Policy (flag) and Decline limits. Physical card transactions and manually submitted expenses will be combined to calculate the Policy (flag) and Decline totals per category. \n\nPolicy: Policy (or flag) limits define when administrators should be alerted that a transaction has exceeded the limit for that expense category \nDecline: Decline limits will reject transactions on TripActions Liquid physical cards at the point of sale and will flag manually submitted expenses once they are submitted \nBoth Policy and Decline limits can be set according to a Max price per transaction and/or a Max price per time period (if both are set, the lower value will apply). If Hide policy details from users is selected, users will not be able to see the specifics of the limits you have configured and will see a \"Use responsibly\" message instead; administrators will still be alerted of policy violations. \n \n\nScreen Shot 2021-07-28 at 4.54.36 PM.png\n \nSummary: Policy Configuration Steps\nNow that we've learned about expense categories and their associated settings, let's review the sequence of steps required to configure your policies: \n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy\nBegin by selecting the Payments & expensing category to set general parameters for physical TripActions Liquid card use, virtual TripActions Liquid card use, purchase card use, manual expenses, and fraud prevention limits. See the Payments & Expensing section of this article for more information on this category. \nNext, set the policies for each of the remaining expense categories: \nSelect the expense category you would like to set a policy for \nBegin by clicking + Enable \nClick the first two column headers to assign the policy to the desired users (i.e. Region and Department)\n[Optional] Assign a GL code to the policy using the dropdown under the GL-code column. Note: A GL code is required in the Travel expenses category \nToggle on Allow expenses of this type under the Policy column and set Decline limits\nIf your company has multiple legal entities/issuing currencies set up, see this article for additional information on how they impact your flag and decline thresholds \nClick the Approval column to designate approvals to the TripActions Liquid administrator, the users' manager, or to an individual within your company\n[Optional] Click on the ellipsis menu (three dots) and select any desired Custom fields for transactions within this expense category \nClick Save changes. Your new policy will be effective immediately. \nimage.png\n \nNote: For instructions specific to configuring a per diem (daily meal allowance) expense policy, see this article.",

    "body": "Using Your Per Diem Allowance\nIf your company admin has assigned you a per diem (daily) meal allowance for on-trip meal expenses, you can easily claim your allowance via the TripActions mobile or web app. Claiming a per diem allowance eliminates the need to keep and submit receipts for each meal purchased while on a trip. \n\nDepending on your assigned policy, you may be eligible to receive a per diem for any of the below: \n\nFull day: The amount you can spend for each full day of travel \nPartial day: The amount you can spend for any partial travel days \nLodging: An additional allowance for lodging booked outside of TripActions\nWhen submitting a per diem claim, you will be shown your allowance amount once you enter your trip information, such as destination and duration. \n\nNote: Duration of travel is determined by what is booked on the TripActions platform. \n\n\nClaiming your Allowance\nAll per diem claims can be submitted through the TripActions Liquid mobile app by following these steps:\n\nFrom the app homepage, select +New transaction.\nTap Claim per diem \nSelect the Trip associated with your claim (your trip dates and allowance will populate automatically) or select Not on a trip if you are submitting a per diem claim for a trip booked outside of TripActions (Note: Claims not attached to a TripActions trip will be flagged to your admin for approval).\nAdd a destination: Your company may allow higher or lower per diem amounts based on your travel destination. If you are claiming for a trip booked outside of TripActions or if you visited another location while on the trip selected, tap Add destination to record the time spent in that location. Your allowance may update as a result of your added destinations. \nEdit your claim options as needed. For example, you may wish to edit the automatically calculated per diem amount or type of claim (i.e., you have been given a partial day claim but would like to request a full day claim or change your claim amount from $75 to $100). (Note: All edits will be flagged to your admin for approval).\n[If applicable] Your company may require a per diem claim deduction for any meal expenses already covered by the company (i.e., office lunch). You will see a list of Deductions and the set deduction amount to choose from. \nEnter any additional trip details or comments to your admin into the Description box (i.e., You can use this field to enter in your reasoning for claiming a higher per diem amount than what you were provided).\nTap Submit to submit your claim for reimbursement\n \nClaim per diem\n\nPolicy Considerations\nPer diem claims within your assigned per diem policy will be automatically approved for reimbursement unless your admin has requested to manually approve all per diem requests. You can submit per diem requests for reimbursement on a daily or trip basis but not in advance of a trip. Per diem requests may be flagged for review by your admin for the following reasons:\n\nYour per diem claim is not attached to a TripActions trip\nYou have made manual edits to the auto-populated trip dates (i.e., you selected a trip booked in TripActions for September 7-10 but then manually edited your trip's dates to September 7-12) \nMeal expenses were already submitted for this day on a TripActions physical card (see the TripActions Liquid Physical Cards section to learn more).\nYou have made edits to the per diem allowance amount that was automatically provided based on the trip you selected\n \nTripActions Liquid physical cards & per diems\nIf you choose to use your TripActions Liquid physical card for meal expenses while traveling, meals purchased on your card will not automatically go towards your per diem allowance. In these cases, you will need to claim the difference in cost between what is spent on your card and your per diem allowance. For example, if you purchase a $20 lunch using your physical card, and your company has assigned you a $50 per diem allowance, you will need to make a per diem claim for $30.\n\nPer diem claims submitted for the same day as meal charges on a physical card will be flagged for approval by your admin. If you need to see your allowable travel related meal expenses outside of your per diem allowance (i.e. what you can charge on your physical card), navigate to Policy > On Trip > Traveling meals for myself.",

    "body": "Travel Approvals in TripActions\nTo ensure that travel program managers have full visibility and control over their travelers' bookings while also providing travelers with sufficient booking flexibility, TripActions offers two booking approval options: \n\nSoft Out-of-Policy: Approvers/managers are notified of out-of-policy bookings and have the option to cancel them on the traveler's behalf within 24 hours.\nNo Approval Required: No notifications are sent to approvers/managers when out-of-policy bookings are made.\n\nSetting Policy Approvals in TripActions \nPolicy controls can be applied by booking type through the Booking approval section of your Travel policy and Guest policy configuration pages.\n\nimage.png\n\nSoft Out-of-Policy\nThe soft out-of-policy approval option provides travel managers with control and visibility, while allowing travelers the flexibility to book the appropriate travel to meet their business needs. \n\nWhen the soft out-of-policy approval option is selected, it will apply to all users assigned to that policy. Travel approvers (or managers) for these users will then be notified via email each time one of their travelers makes a booking that violates their assigned policy. Once the out-of-policy email is sent, the recipient has the option to cancel the booking by clicking Cancel Booking in the email within 24 hours* after the email is sent. If the recipient clicks Cancel Booking, they will be taken to the TripActions platform to Confirm Cancelation and provide a reason for the cancelation to the traveler. \n\n*The 24-hour window to take action on a booking may differ from the void or cancelation window for the booking and therefore may not be refunded if canceled. Designated approvers can view cancelation and refund information directly in the out-of-policy email notification. \n\nSoft Out-of-Policy Approval Flow: \n\nScreen Shot 2021-08-18 at 3.21.26 PM.png\nOut-of-policy bookings can also be viewed by admins on the Approvals page of the Admin Dashboard or by travel approvers on the Manager Dashboard. \n\nOverride Booking Approver\nAdmins have the ability to assign another user within their company to approve out-of-policy bookings. See this article for more information. \n\nExperience for Travelers \nBooking options that are out-of-policy will be surfaced to travelers each time they run a flight, hotel, train, or car search and are marked with a shield icon on the search results page as well as the inventory details page (i.e. room details page on hotel bookings). When hovered over, an out-of-policy reason will be visible to the traveler. Travelers can also view their assigned policies on the search homepage by clicking My [flight, hotel, car, train] policy.\n\nScreen Shot 2022-02-24 at 5.04.18 PM.png\nIf a traveler chooses to move forward with an out-of-policy booking, the checkout page will prompt them to type in the reason for the out-of-policy booking as well as to acknowledge that the booking may be canceled by their manager. If an out-of-policy booking is canceled by the approver, an email will be sent to the traveler, along with any other notification types enabled in their profile settings (such as SMS or push notifications). \n\nScreen Shot 2022-02-24 at 5.13.13 PM.png\n\nNo Approval Required\nWhen the No Approval Required option is selected, it will apply to all users assigned to that policy and no out-of-policy notifications will be sent to travel approvers, regardless of whether bookings violate the user's assigned policies. \n \n\nGuest Booking Approvals \nFor information on approvals for bookings made via the Guest Invite tool, see the Invite Creator and Guest Experience section of this article. \n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: [Assuming soft out-of-policy has been selected] An out-of-policy booking was made by an admin on behalf of another traveler; why was no out-of-policy email sent? \nA: Admins do not have any enforced policy approvals. Therefore, if a company admin books on behalf of a colleague and books outside of their assigned policy, the out-of-policy flow will be overridden since the booker is a company admin with the ability to set company policies. \n\nQ: How do soft out-of-policy approvals work for booking delegates? \nA: When delegates book for other travelers by logging in as them in TripActions, any bookings made will be subject to the policy assigned to that traveler (not the delegate's policy). If a delegate books for another traveler through their own profile, any bookings made will be subject to their own (the delegate's) assigned policy. \n\nQ: Are bookings made via Trip Proposal still marked as out-of-policy?  \nA: Yes. Bookings made via Trip Proposal are still subject to the traveler's assigned policies and approval flow. ",

Per diem allowances eliminate the need for employees to collect and submit receipts for every meal, and can be configured according to criteria such as duration and destination of travel*. \n\nThere are three main components to setting up a per diem allowance policy:\n\nEnabling per diem allowances under your expense policies and setting your policy approval flow \nAssigning per diem policies to your desired users (who has the ability to claim per diem)\nSetting your allowances (how much users receive) \n*Duration and destination of travel are determined by what is booked on the TripActions platform. \n\nRead below to find out how you can set up your per diem policies according to each of the configuration options available in TripActions Liquid. \n \n\nPer Diem Policy Options and Configuration Steps\nPer diem allowances can be configured as a default policy that applies to all users who are eligible for per diem expenses according to their assigned policy, or can be based on the eligible user's location and/or travel destination. Below are the available policy options and corresponding configuration steps. \n\n[Option 1] Standard Policy \nPer diem allowance is not based on a user's origin or travel destination. For example, all users eligible for per diem, based anywhere in the world and traveling to anywhere in the world, will receive a $75 allowance. \n\nHow to configure: \n\nEnable the Per Diem expense category (Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy > On-trip expenses > Per Diem > Enable)\nApply the per diem expense policy to your desired users. The per diem expense policy allows you to enable users by individual or by groups of users according to common attributes (region, cost center, etc).\nNext, define your allowances (per diem rates) for the individuals/groups of users who have access to per diem expenses by clicking on Add per diem rates. \nSelect Default/All other employees and click Add tables to set your rates (allowances). \nClick into the Full day column, type in your desired allowance, and click Save changes\nScreen Shot 2022-01-19 at 12.43.21 PM.pngScreen Shot 2022-01-19 at 12.59.12 PM.png\n \n\n[Option 2] Policy Based on Destination\nAllowance is based on a user's travel destination. For example, all users eligible for per diem who are traveling to Australia will receive an $85 per diem allowance, versus a $75 per diem allowance when traveling to the United States. \n\nHow to configure: \n\nComplete all of the configuration steps for Option 1\nNext, click + Add destination and type in the destination that you would like to set a separate allowance for. \nSelect the Currency and Full day allowance amount; we recommend setting your allowance in the currency of the destination (i.e. if adding Finland as a destination, set your allowances in EUR). \nAdd any other destinations for which you would like to set a separate allowance\nClick Save changes\nScreen Shot 2022-01-18 at 2.02.53 PM.png\n\n[Option 3] Policy Based on Origin Country \nAllowance is based on the user's origin country (defined by the location of the user's assigned legal entity on the main TripActions user list) regardless of their travel destination. For example, eligible users based in the United States receive an allowance of $75, whereas eligible users based in the United Kingdom receive an allowance of £65. \n\nHow to configure: \n\nComplete all of the configuration steps for Option 1 \nNext, select + Add another country \nSelect from your company's list of countries, based on the legal entities you have configured in TripActions. \nClick Add tables\nClick into the Full day column for each of the added countries, type in your desired allowance, and click Save changes. \n\n[Option 4] Policy Based on Origin Country AND Travel Destination \nAllowance is determined by the user's origin country and travel destination. For example, eligible users based in Germany and traveling within Germany receive an allowance of €70, however, when eligible users based in Germany visit Finland, their allowance increases to €80.\n\nHow to configure: \n\nFollow the steps to create separate origin country allowances as outlined under option 3, and then follow the steps to set destination(s) for each country as outlined under option 2.\n \n\nAdditional Per Diem Rate Types\nUnder each of your per diem policies, you will have the ability to configure additional rate types (in addition to the default Full day rate type). These rate types include Lodging (an additional allowance for travel booked outside of TripActions) and Partial day (an allowance for partial day travel). \n\nTo set additional rate types: \n\nClick Go to per diem rates from the main per diem expense policy page (Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy > On-trip expenses > Per Diem > Enable)\nClick Edit columns and toggle on your desired additional rate types\nClick Update\nEnter in values for your new rate types\nRepeat for all other countries as needed\nClick Save changes\nScreen Shot 2022-01-19 at 1.25.18 PM.pngScreen Shot 2022-01-14 at 3.51.26 PM.png\n\nDeductions\nTo account for meals already provided to your employees by the company (i.e. office lunch), you can set a deduction amount(s) for any of your policies. \n\nTo set deductions:  \n\nClick Go to per diem rates from the main per diem expense policy page (Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy > On-trip expenses > Per Diem > Enable)\nClick Add next to No deductions added \nCreate a Label and set a percentage amount for each deduction; your employees will then have the option to select from these deduction types when submitting a per diem claim. Note: All deductions are submitted at the discretion of the employee and cannot be made required at this time. \nScreen Shot 2022-01-18 at 1.59.37 PM.png\n \nOther Configuration Options\nOnce your per diem policies and rates have been configured, you will have the option to assign associated per diem expenses with a particular GL-code, set custom fields for employees to fill out when submitting a per diem claim, delegate per diem approvals to a designated approver*, and select whether approvals for per diem expenses are required for all claims or only claims that violate the set allowance for that user. All of these options can be configured under (Travel | Book > Liquid > Admin > Policy > On-trip expenses > Per Diem). \n\nimage.png\n\nManaging Per Diem Transactions (claims)\nYour employees can begin claiming their set per diem allowance as soon as your policies have been configured and assigned. For information on reviewing and managing your employees' per diem claims, see this article. \n\n \n\nWant to see a video tutorial on setting up per diem allowances in TripActions Liquid?

    "body": "Organizing an Team Event in TripActions\nThe TripActions Team Event feature allows managers, travel admins, and other designated individuals to easily organize group travel for up to 25 participants directly in the TripActions platform. Travelers receive an invitation to book via email and are guided through the booking process according to company travel policy and event preferences. Organizers are provided with estimated costs of travel prior to sending out invites, and kept updated on actual costs as bookings are made by their invited travelers. Continue reading to learn how to create a team event. \n\nNote: For information on who has access to team events and other general feature settings, see this article. \n\n\nCreating a New Team Event\nCreate a new Team Event invite by selecting the Create a team event tab from your TripActions homepage and taking the following actions: \n\nEnter an event name \nSpecify the office or location where the event will take place\nSelect the event dates\nEnter the list of participants invited to the event; you will be able to select from anyone on the company's user list with a status of Enabled \nNote: If an invite is sent to someone on your user list who has been invited to join TripActions but has not yet completed registration, they will need to do so before they can book their travel. \nOnce this information is entered, click Next to move to the event configuration page\nScreen Shot 2021-08-17 at 4.45.59 PM.png\n\nConfiguring Your Team Event\nThe configuration page is comprised of three main sections, which include hotel booking options, participants and estimated costs, and a summary and settings page.  \n\nHotel Booking Options\nIn the first portion of the event configuration, you will be able to select whether you would like event participants to self book hotel rooms or use room blocks. Listed below are recommendations to consider when deciding between these two options: \n\nParticipants will self book a hotel room: We recommend utilizing the self booking option if your event is taking place within the next seven days for domestic events or ten days for international events. Self book is also best for instances where event participants may require flexible cancelation terms.\nParticipants will use a room block: We recommend a room block if you are intending to book 10+ rooms with at least two weeks notice. Room blocks allow you to secure room inventory in advance at a discounted rate and may include other hotel perks depending on the vendor. Room blocks require a minimum of ten rooms and a contract for the block. It typically takes 2-3 business days to set up a room block and cancellation terms are often strict.\nIf you select Invitees will self book a hotel room, you can choose up to five hotel suggestions for your participants to consider when making their booking. If your company has a corporate negotiated rate loaded in TripActions, you will see these hotels listed as proposed suggestions for your invitees. However, all lodging options available on the TripActions platform can be added as a recommended hotel.\n\nimage.png\nIf you select Participants will use a room block, you will be provided with the following options:\n\nRequest a room block: If you have not already secured a room block and would like assistance from our Meetings & Events team, click Request room block. After completing the form, a team member will begin sourcing hotel options and contact you within 24 hours of receiving the request.\nRoom block details: If you have already secured a room block, you can use this feature to load room assignments, assign costs, and send participant information directly to the hotel. For instructions on how to use this feature, view this article.\nimage.png\n\nParticipants and Estimated Costs\nThe second section of the configuration page allows you to specify which aspects of travel each participant can book (flights, hotel, car, train). You will also be able to set the Departing from field for each invitee, and indicate whether they can bring one extra guest to the event. Based on the parameters you set, an estimated individual cost (per invitee) and total cost of the event will be listed under Estimated travel cost. Estimated costs will automatically update as you make changes to your selections and are based on median price.\n\nimage.png\n \nSummary and Settings\nThe last section of the team event configuration page provides a summary of the event details, allows you to set travel date parameters, and configure reporting settings. To allow participants to book outside of the event dates, select Flexible booking date. This option is often used to combat jet lag, add a business meeting, or simply provide participants with added booking flexibility. To have participants only book within the specified event days, choose Invitees can only book within the event's date range. Please note that the flexible booking feature includes all aspects of travel, including accommodations, and may be costly. \n\nThe Reporting settings section will allow you to choose between using each participant's individual attributes (as assigned in the TripActions user list) for reporting purposes, or to allocate your event to a single cost-center, region, department, and/or subsidiary. All data associated with the event will be available in the TripActions booking report. \n\nChanges will save automatically and you will have the option to Delete draft or Send invite. If you exit out of the draft, you will see the invite marked as a Draft on the Events tab. \n\nimage.png\n\nPayments, Trip Fees, and Policy \nPayment\nPayment for group events will default to whatever payment methods are typically available/prioritized for the participants on the TripActions platform when they book travel. For example, if a participant typically has a corporate card available to them for booking travel in TripActions, this same card will be available when booking travel via a Team Travel invite. \n\nTrip Fees\nA Trip Fee is a single fee charged per itinerary (Trip) and can include multiple bookings. A Trip with the event name is automatically created once a booking for a team event is made. Additional bookings for the event will be added to the trip already created. Each invitee and guest will be charged a trip fee, which will be reflected on the invoice for the first booking of the trip. For more information about trip fees, view this article.\n\nPolicy and Approvals \nParticipants will be able to book travel in accordance with the existing booking policies assigned to them by the company's account admin. In the instance that an invitee makes an out-of-policy booking, the event organizer will be notified and have the ability to take action on the booking; the participants default travel approver/manager will not be notified. If your company policy requires that a participant's manager approves a trip prior to booking through a Trip Proposal, a Team Travel invitation will serve as an approval for booking. Therefore, participants will not be prompted to submit a proposal prior to booking their trip through team travel. \n\n\nViewing Events\nEvent organizers can see a list of all upcoming, completed, and canceled events by clicking the Events tab on their booking homepage. Use the search bar and filters to locate an event, and click on an event to view event details. From the event's page, you can see the booking status of each participant, track spend, cancel, or change the event. Additionally, event creators will have access to a dashboard view of an event's spend data from the Manager Dashboard.\n\nimage.png \n\nParticipant (Invitee) Experience\nSee this article for insight into the participant experience, including notifications and the booking process. \n\n\nModifying or Canceling Events\nSee this article for information on modifying or canceling a team event. \n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can TripActions help book for groups of 25+ or for groups needing meeting space?\nA: Yes! If you have a group travel request for 25+ people or require assistance with booking a meeting space, requests can be made through our Groups & Meetings intake form. Our team will respond to these requests within 24 hours. \n\nQ: Can TripActions help with high-touch flight requests as well?\nA: Yes, if you have a flight request that requires high-touch support, like chartering planes, please get in touch with your Meetings & Events team by sending an email to meetingsandevents@tripactions.com.\n\nQ: Can I assign an outside delegate to organize an event within TripActions?\nA: At this time, group travel can only be organized by individuals within your organization with an active TripActions account.\n\nQ: Are travelers able to earn TripActions Rewards when booking Team Travel?\nA: Yes, for companies that have this feature enabled, rewards will display when booking a car or hotel for a team event. For more information about TripActions Rewards, view this article. \n\nQ: Can a participant decline a team event in TripActions?\nA: Yes, participants are able to decline a team event through their email invitation or on their TripActions Invitations page. When a participant declines an event, their status on the main event page will show as Declined and the event creator will be notified via email. \n\nQ: Is there a window of time that an invitee has to book a team invite? Do invitations expire? \nA: Team event invitations do not have a mandated booking period but invitees are obliged to follow booking policy guidelines. For example, if a user's flight policy mandates that all flights should be booked seven days in advance and an invitee books six days in advance, the booking will be marked as out-of-policy. Additionally, a booking invitation will expire once the dates for the team event are in the past.\n\n ",

    "body": "TripActions Liquid™ Expense Approval Process \nTripActions Liquid automates the expense approval process for transactions made with a physical TripActions Liquid card or submitted manually for out-of-pocket expenses, eliminating the need for time-consuming expense reports. To facilitate this, TripActions uses data received from merchants and determines the expense policy that should be applied to every transaction. From there, TripActions looks at the applicable policy and determines if the transaction should be automatically approved, flagged for review, or rejected. Read below to find out more. \n\n\nPolicy Components \nWhether your transactions are approved, flagged, or declined/rejected will depend on the expense policies that have been assigned to you by your company's TripActions Liquid admin. TripActions Liquid expense policies apply to both physical cards and out-of-pocket (manual) expenses and include the below components: \n\nPolicy limit: The monetary limit at which a transaction will be flagged for review by your company's TripActions Liquid admin.\nPolicy limits can be viewed in the Policy section of your account in the TripActions Liquid mobile app.\nDecline limit: The monetary limit at which a transaction will be automatically declined at the point of sale or automatically rejected for reimbursement.\nIf you attempt to submit a manual expense or swipe your card for a transaction exceeding this limit, you will be notified in the TripActions Liquid mobile app, by email, and via push notification (if enabled).\nReceipt requirement: Whether a receipt is necessary for a transaction\nMay be set to Always required, Never required, or Required over a certain amount (i.e. $75)\nReceipt requirements may vary based on whether a transactions was submitted as a manual expense or charged to a physical TripActions Liquid card.\nRequirements will be surfaced to you in the TripActions Liquid mobile app, by email, and via push notification (if enabled) whenever you attempt to submit a manual expense or swipe your card for a transaction requiring a receipt.\n \n\nIn Policy Transactions\nTripActions Liquid physical card transactions \nTransactions charged to a physical card that are compliant with the policies assigned to you will be automatically approved and require no further action. \n\nManually submitted transactions \nManual expensing allows you to submit and receive reimbursement for expenses paid for out-of-pocket; once your manual expense transaction details have been submitted in the TripActions Liquid mobile app, your expense will be automatically approved and processed for reimbursement if it is compliant with your assigned policy. \n \n\nOut-of-Policy Transactions\nTripActions Liquid physical card transactions \nTransactions charged to a physical card that are not compliant with the policies assigned to you will be flagged for review and will be subsequently approved or rejected, based on your approver's (program administrator or manager) discretion: \n\nIf your approver has reviewed a transaction and rejected it, they may request full or partial repayment of the company funds. In this case, you will be notified that you need to provide repayment in the TripActions Liquid mobile app, by email, and via push notification (if enabled). Additionally, all pending repayment requests can be viewed directly in the You need to pay section of your mobile app. See this article for information on how to complete a repayment request.\nIf your approver needs more information about a transaction before approving or rejecting it, you will see it appear in the Info required section of your TripActions Liquid mobile app. You will be able to provide more information about the transaction to your approver directly in the mobile app. \nManually submitted transactions \nManually submitted transactions that are not compliant with the policies assigned to you will be flagged for review and will be subsequently approved for full reimbursement, approved for partial reimbursement, or rejected based on your approver's discretion. These transactions can be viewed under the In review section of your TripActions Liquid mobile app; if your approver needs more information about the transaction, you will see it appear in the Info required section. \n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: How do I order a TripActions Liquid card?\nA: If your company's TripActions Liquid administrator has granted you access to using a physical card, you can follow the instructions outlined in this article to order one. Please note that your administrator may choose to order a card on your behalf; connect with them for more information. \n\nQ: How long is the reimbursement process for manual transactions?\nA: Reimbursements can be processed via payroll or by linking your personal bank account to the TripActions Liquid mobile app; reimbursement times will vary depending on which method you select. See the Reimbursement Process section of this article for details. ",

    "body": "Using a Virtual Card for Pay-at-Hotel Bookings\nTripActions Liquid™ virtual cards allow travelers to book pay-at-hotel (also known as pay-later) reservations without having to pay for the booking with a personal card at check-in. The TripActions Liquid virtual card will be authorized to include the cost of the hotel stay plus any items from the hotel that align with your company policy.\n\n\nSending Payment Information to the Hotel\nWhen a pay-at-hotel booking is made using a TripActions Liquid virtual card, TripActions automatically sends a Credit Card Authorization (CCA) form directly to the hotel. In order to facilitate a smooth check-in, TripActions follows the process listed below when sending CCAs:\n\nTripActions securely sends an email or fax to the hotel's primary CCA contact or to a known hotel email/fax number.\nIf check-in is within four days: The CCA form will be sent within one hour after booking\nIf check-in is in more than four days: The CCA form will be sent within 24 hours after booking. This ensures that if a traveler cancels their booking shortly after a booking is made, no CCA form will be sent. \nIf we are notified that a CCA form has not been received by the hotel (i.e. the fax number is busy, the email is undeliverable, there is no fax or email listed for the property), a member of the TripActions Travel Experience Team will contact the hotel prior to check-in to provide the CCA form.\n\nCCAs are a globally recognized method of payment, however, each hotel property has the ability to specify a unique process for payment collection. Despite the steps taken to ensure that the hotel receives payment prior to check-in, there are instances where the hotel does not receive the CCA form or does not process the form prior to check-in. If you need to access a copy of the virtual card or CCA form sent to the hotel for your booking, view this article for instructions. \n\nAn alternative option to CCAs is to provide travelers with a TripActions Liquid physical card. Cards can be automatically activated and deactivated specifically for a trip and approval and decline limits are set within your TripActions Liquid expense policy. \n\nNote: Most hotels will still require that a physical credit card is provided upon check-in to cover the cost of out-of-policy incidentals. \n\nSample CCA form:\n\nScreen Shot 2021-06-10 at 10.41.01 AM.png\n \nAccessing a Virtual Card Information and CCA Form\nIf you need to access a copy of the virtual card or CCA form sent to the hotel for your booking, view this article for instructions.\n\n\nFor TripActions Liquid Account Admins\nCCA functionality will be made available to your employees by default if you are leveraging TripActions Liquid virtual cards. If your company is also utilizing TripActions Liquid Expense, you will have access to configuring additional settings pertaining to virtual card transactions for pay later hotels, including setting your desired receipt requirements.

If your organization is transitioning to TripActions from another Travel Management Company (TMC), there are a number of items that we recommend considering and taking action on to ensure a seamless transition. Read below to find out more. \n \n\n90 Days Prior to the Transition\nNotify your previous TMC of termination \nReview your company's contract with your prior TMC to determine if there is a specific advanced notice period required. If no such notice period exists we recommend providing 60-90 days' notice from the time that your TripActions contract is signed. \n\nSet a transition date\nDetermine a date when employees should stop using your prior TMC to book travel. When providing notice to your prior TMC, you should also give a \"last date of travel policy\" in order to limit the number of future reservations for them to manage. \n\nRequest reports from prior TMC\nTravel Managers should run or request reports from their prior TMC to determine when live reservations end. This is helpful for planning the communications surrounding the transition and advising employees at what point they should start booking travel in TripActions. Additional reports to request and run may include historic travel data for air, car, and hotel, as well as any unused ticket (flight credits) data available.\n\nGather copies of existing supplier contracts \nEnsure that you have access to all supplier agreements including air, hotel, rail, rental car, and black car. \n\nNotify suppliers that your organization is transitioning to TripActions \nAdvise any suppliers with whom you have an existing corporate relationship that you will be loading their agreements into TripActions and request support with the transition if needed. \n \n\n60 Days Prior to the Transition\nSet up a meeting between your previous agency and TripActions (recommended for global enterprise customers)\nRequest a meeting with your prior TMC and TripActions to ensure alignment on timeline, decisions, and tasks.\n\nRequest a new form of payment \nIf your company is using any kind of shared form of payment to pay for travel (centralized credit card, Lodge Card, or Ghost Card), we recommend acquiring a new card from your bank so it does not have blended charges from TripActions and your prior TMC.\n \n\n30 Days Prior to the Transition\nCapture traveler loyalty information prior to transitioning \nAdvise employees that they should capture and save any loyalty numbers or profile details stored in their prior TMC profile before transitioning to TripActions. \n\n",

    "body": "Designating an Expense Approver\nBy default, flagged (out-of-policy) transactions are routed to TripActions Liquid admins for review and approval. Additionally, admins have the option to delegate approvals to a user's manager (as assigned in TripActions), or to specific individual users on the company's main TripActions user list. Designated approvers will be granted access to a dashboard where they can easily view transaction activity as well as take action on flagged transactions. \n\nManagers as Approvers\nManagers can be designated as approvers for any policy group (i.e. EMEA Sales Department). When this is done, all users within that policy group will have their flagged transactions routed to their assigned manager for review and approval. If a user does not have an assigned manager, those approvals will be routed to the admin. If the user's manager changes or leaves the company, any outstanding flagged transactions will be routed to the new manager. \n\nIndividual Users as Approvers\nAny user that is Enabled on your company's TripActions user list can be designated as an approver. Multiple users can be selected for each policy group (i.e. EMEA Sales Department) within each expense category. When an individual user is added as an approver, all associated flagged transactions will be routed to the individual(s) selected for review and approval.\n\nWhen multiple users are assigned as an approver, each approver will be notified of the flagged transaction and prompted to review. The first person to take action will become the approver. All other designated approvers will be able to view the flagged transaction, however, they cannot take action once another approver has taken steps to approve or decline. For information about the process of managing transactions as a designated approver, see this article.\n \n\nDesignated Approver (Manager or Individual) Capabilities  \nA designated approver has the ability to...\n\nReview, approve, or reject transactions.\nRequest full or partial repayment for rejected transactions.\nRequest more information from the user for their transactions.\nEdit transaction properties such as the cost center, policy, or any custom fields.\nRequest that the employee make changes, add, or delete receipts.\nAdd or delete receipts themselves.\nA designated approver is NOT able to...\n\nOverride any action taken by a TripActions Liquid admin. Admins may preempt or override a designated approver's decision to approve a flagged transaction. An approver can view the transaction history but cannot reverse the admin's decision.\n \nDesignating Approvers\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy\nSelect an expense category, and choose the sub-category that you would like to designate an approver for (i.e Travel expenses > Train travel).\nNavigate to the Approval column and select User's Manager or Individual (Note: Only one can be selected at a time).\nIf User's Manager is selected, managers will be automatically assigned based on your TripActions user list.\nIf Individual is selected, begin typing a user's name to assign an approver.

    "body": "Creating & Assigning Travel Policies in TripActions\nTripActions aims to simplify the travel policy set-up process by offering configuration flexibility and providing dynamic policy controls based on fair market pricing. In the Admin Dashboard, TripActions administrators can easily configure travel policies for flights, hotels, and car rentals. Additionally, you are able to configure policies using a tiered approach, allowing for various policy levels for different groups of users. Adjustments to travel policies can be made at any time and will automatically reflect for your travelers so that they are always booking according to your most current guidelines. To find out how you can set your policies and assign them to the desired travelers, read below.\nNote: This article covers the process for updating policies within the TripActions Admin Dashboard; for recommendations and best practices for setting new policies, please see this article.\nCreating your Policies\nNavigate to the Admin Dashboard and select the Policy tab\nChoose the policy level you would like to configure. By default, you will have three policy buckets available: Default, Director, and Executive. If needed, you may also add up to six additional policy buckets by selecting + Create New Policy Level.\nUnder each policy level, you can set your policies by booking type: Short flights, Medium flights*, Long flights, Hotels, Trains, and Rental car. You will also be able to enable Black Car bookings and Trip Proposals under each policy level.\n*Note: If you would like to utilize the Medium flights policy, contact your Customer Success Manager to enable.\nClick the down arrow to the right of the policy you would like to update and set each of the available configurations according to your preferences. For example, when setting hotel policies, you will be able to set the configurations as shown in the below screenshot.\nRepeat these steps for all other policy levels and booking types\nAssigning Policies to Your Travelers\nOnce you have created your policy levels, you will want to ensure that your travelers are assigned to the appropriate policy.

    "body": "Assigning Policies to TripActions Liquid™ Users \nSetting the right expense policies in TripActions Liquid provides finance teams with enhanced cost-control while enabling cardholders to spend comfortably. Expense policies and their corresponding approval flows apply to both transactions made on TripActions Liquid physical cards, as well as manual transactions submitted for out-of-pocket expenses. \n\nAn important part of the expense policy setting process is ensuring that the policies for all of your enabled expense categories have been appropriately assigned to your employees, based on their spend needs. In TripActions Liquid, administrators can assign policies in two different ways: \n\nBy user attribute: Assign policies based on your employees' (users) attributes, such as department, cost center, region, and more. User attributes are configured in the main TripActions Admin Dashboard under User List and can be maintained manually, or through an HRIS integration.\nBy individual: Assign policies to individual users based on their unique spend needs. \nBy default, the policies for all enabled expense categories will be applied to your entire company (everyone on your TripActions user list). To find out how you can make changes to the default setting and apply policies by attributes or individual, read below. \n \n\nAssigning Policies by User Attributes\nAs a best practice, we recommend assigning users to policies based on their user attributes. This will ensure that individuals with similar attributes who are permitted the same expenses are easily placed within the same expense policies. When assigning policies by attribute, you will have the ability to assign based on a primary attribute, as well as a secondary attribute. \n\nFor example... \n\nLet's assign a policy to your Customer Support team in EMEA. In this case, your primary attribute is Department (Customer Support) and your secondary attribute is Region (EMEA). To assign a policy to these users, you would: \n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy\nSelect the expense category you would like to set a policy for from the menu on the left (i.e. On-trip expenses) and then select the expense sub-category (i.e. Traveling: taxi & rideshare).\nClick into the Apply to column to begin assigning your attributes. \nUnder Primary attribute, select Customer Support (Department). \nUnder Secondary attribute, select EMEA (Region). \nClick Save changes at the bottom of the screen.\nScreen Shot 2021-07-27 at 11.17.36 AM.png\n \nNote: If the attribute you are looking for does not appear in the dropdown menu, this indicates that this attribute has not been configured within your TripActions user list. You will need to ensure it has been configured on the user list before you can assign expense policies using this attribute.  \n \n\nAssigning Policies by Individual\nThere may be instances in which you would like to assign an expense policy to an individual user, based on their unique spend needs and regardless of their user list attributes. Additionally, if your user list is small (less than 30 employees) it may make sense to assign expense policies at the individual level. \n\nTo assign a policy to an individual, follow these steps: \n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Policy\nSelect the expense category you would like to set a policy for from the menu on the left (i.e. On-trip expenses) and then select the expense sub-category (i.e. Traveling: taxi & rideshare).\nClick into the Apply to column and select Add individual users.\nBegin typing in the name of the user(s) under Assign users by name. You may add multiple users at once. \nClick Update to save your changes. \nScreen Shot 2021-07-27 at 11.18.08 AM.png\nOnce the individual user(s) have been assigned to the policy, you will see them listed under Individual user/s on the policy page and can click on Details to see their names \nScreen Shot 2021-07-27 at 11.22.54 AM.png\n\nMultiple Policy Assignments \nIf a user is assigned to a policy based on one attribute and later assigned to an additional policy, then the user will automatically adopt the least restrictive policy. As an example, let's consider user Britt Johnson, who is part of the Customer Support department on her company's user list. First, the company administrator assigns Britt to the Taxi & rideshare policy as an individual user. Then, Britt's department, Customer Support, is subsequently assigned to the same Taxi & rideshare policy with a different, higher spend threshold than what was first assigned to Britt as an individual user. In this case, Britt's spend for Taxi & rideshare expenses will be dictated by the least restrictive policy, which is the one assigned to her department. \n \n\nViewing Policy\nAfter your policies have been assigned to your users, you can review policy assignments in the Policy section of the Liquid admin dashboard. Additionally, you can view each individual user's assigned policy under Liquid | Admin > Company > Users > Active Users. Click on a user and select the Policy tab. \n\nScreen Shot 2021-07-27 at 12.40.31 PM.png\n\nFor customers who have implemented TripActions Liquid Expense policies prior to August 4, 2021: \nPlease note that your current expense policies will be automatically migrated over to the new policy assignment logic outlined in this article. Your migrated policies will be organized by individual user groupings, composed of users with the same policy rules as what you had originally configured; all users with the same policy in an expense category will be grouped together regardless of their previous policy group. \n\n\nFor example... \nIf you had a previously configured a policy group for all of your VPs and Directors, these individuals will now be grouped together and will appear under Individual user/s on your updated policy page for all applicable policies. You will be able to click on Details next to each grouping to see a list of users in this group. To update any of these groups and assign new attributes from your TripActions user list, click the into the Apply to column on the policy page and follow the steps outlined in this article. ",

If a transaction requires further action, you can complete any required information by logging in as the user as outlined in the above section.\nOnce a transaction has been approved, users who have linked their personal bank account to their TripActions Liquid profile will receive reimbursement via direct deposit within a few business days of the transaction approval date. Users who do not wish to or cannot link their personal bank account will be reimbursed according to their company's regular payroll cycle.\nNeed more information or assistance?

    "body": "Carbon Budgeting and Real-Time Analytics\nTripActions offers customers the real-time data, tools, and information needed to make sustainable decisions and reduce the environmental impact of travel. We recommend the following approach to track and reduce your organization's carbon impact: \n\nBuild a carbon budget: Build a yearly carbon emissions target to ensure your company monitors and reduces its carbon footprint.\nAnalyze impact: Analyze your company’s carbon footprint against your budget with real-time insights into department emissions, employee emissions, and travel type. \nOffset emissions: Choose a carbon offsetting initiative that aligns with your company's mission and share your carbon data from TripActions with the program provider to build an offsetting plan.  \nRead below to find out how the tools available in TripActions can help your company track and offset its emissions.\n \n\nSet a Carbon Emissions Target and Preferences\nA carbon emissions budget or target is a goal against which your company can measure CO2 emissions. To set a CO2 budget in TripActions, follow these steps:\n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Settings > Overview and locate the CO2 preferences section.\nEnter a yearly CO2 emissions target; for guidance on setting a target for your company, click science-based targets.\nYour CO2 reporting preferences can also be configured to meet your company's requirements: \n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Settings > Overview and locate the CO2 preferences section.\nUse the toggles next to each booking type (flights, hotels, trains, and car rentals) to enable or disable reporting and use the dropdown menus to select a calculation method. Click learn about calculation methods for guidance on setting a calculation method. \nimage.png\nLastly, you will want to set an Internal carbon fee for your company. An internal carbon fee is the estimated cost to offset each tonne of CO2 produced by your company, should you choose to participate in any carbon offsetting initiatives. TripActions uses a default amount of $12.23 per tonne of CO2 (the average used by many widely used carbon offsetting programs). However, please note that carbon offsetting does not have a universal price and will vary based on the type and location of the offsetting project selected by your company. \n\nimage.png\n\nAnalyze and Report\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Dashboard to view your company's performance against your annual CO2 emissions budget. The dashboard will provide a snapshot of the following:\n\nCO2 emissions (in tonnes) versus your annual emissions target\nCO2  emissions by Booking Type compared to the previous set reporting period\nTotal estimated cost to offset emissions if the company chooses to participate in a carbon offsetting initiative \nimage.png\nTo view detailed reporting on your company's carbon emissions, click Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Analyze > CO2 emissions. Here you can use the filters to get granular insights into your emissions data. Reports found in this dashboard can also be exported and shared with other departments and company stakeholders.\n\nScreen Shot 2021-04-27 at 3.50.20 PM.png\n \nOffset Travel-Related Carbon Emissions \nOnce you have analyzed and collected your carbon emissions data in TripActions, your company may be interested in participating in a carbon offsetting program to reduce the environmental impact of employee travel. If you are already participating in a carbon offsetting program, you can simply provide your company's travel-related carbon emissions data to your carbon offsetting partner, and agree upon an offsetting program and cost. If you would like to explore enrolling in a new carbon offsetting initiative, we recommend visiting goldstandard.org to explore options and get started. \n\nimage.png\n \n\nAdditional Resources \nIn addition to the carbon budgeting and tracking resources provided in TripActions, we have created the below e-books to offer further insights into traveling sustainably. \n\nE-book: Taking steps towards sustainable business travel\n\nHow travel managers can create policies that support travelers in making impactful environmental decisions\nWhat sustainable lifestyle decisions employees can make while on the road\nHow carbon offsetting can help companies move toward a carbon-neutral future\nClick here to access the e-book\n\nE-book: How business travel can support a green recovery\n\nHow to structure travel policies to facilitate the sustainable choices that travelers want\nThe practical steps travel managers can take to lead the way\nHow rail is a bright spot for sustainable European travel and how you can aid its momentum\nClick here to access the e-book",

Once added, users will be able to select from any of the GL codes you have uploaded in TripActions Liquid when submitting a transaction. Tip: This feature is only recommended for companies with a limited number of clearly identifiable GL codes for employees to select from, as choosing the incorrect GL code can lead to erroneous reporting. \n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: If a custom field is enabled on the TripActions Liquid side, does that mean it will also be enabled on the travel side? \nA: No, although custom fields are created within the core TripActions travel product, they can be independently enabled or disabled for each product. For example, a custom field for 'Project code' can be enabled for TripActions Liquid transactions but not required for travel bookings. \n\nQ: If custom field(s) are filled out for a trip booked in TripActions, do those same fields carry over for transactions related to (during) the trip? \nA: Yes, custom fields on travel bookings will also automatically apply to any on-trip transactions. However, if desired, each user will have access to removing the custom field information from their transaction(s) by going into each transaction on their TripActions Liquid app and editing the custom field(s). \n\n",

We will update this article as this offering expands. \n\nQ: Is TripActions violating any privacy regulations by allowing travelers to store health documentation?\nA: No, TripActions is not bound to the same privacy regulations as healthcare and insurance providers.

    "body": "Viewing and Managing Your Spend Limit\nAs a TripActions Liquid administrator, an important aspect of managing your expense program is to actively monitor your company's spend and how it's tracking against your spend limit. Significant ad-hoc increases to spend, such as spend associated with a large event like a Sales Kickoff, may quickly deplete your available funds, and require additional payments to ensure your Liquid account has remaining funds for your typical spend. Read below to learn how you can track spend and limits, as well as best practices for managing spend fluctuations. \n\n\nHow Your Company's Liquid Spend Limit is Determined \nAs your partner in expense management, the TripActions team will work closely with your finance and accounting teams during the sales process to determine an appropriate funding limit for your account. This limit is a global cap for company spend; once this limit has been reached, all transactions will decline, and any reimbursement requests will default to payroll. If there are months where the company will spend more than the agreed-upon monthly limit, TripActions Liquid administrators will have the ability to add more funds into the account by initiating a manual payment.\n\n\nViewing Your Company's Spend Limit\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Company > Settings\nClick on Issuing currency [i.e. USD] and view the Fund information section.\nScreen Shot 2021-05-17 at 3.29.19 PM.png\n \n\nBest Practices for Managing Spend Against Your Limit\nTripActions takes a proactive approach to assist you in managing your Liquid spend so you can reduce situations where there are insufficient funds available to your employees. If a TripActions Liquid account is low on funds, account administrators will receive an email prompting them to initiate a manual payment to the account. The email will be sent once the TripActions Liquid account has less than 30% of its funding limit left, and will also provide an estimate of how long the remaining funds will last based on your company's previous spend history.\n\nIt is important to take immediate action upon receiving this email to ensure you have the right amount of funds in your account. If your Liquid account runs out of funds before your next payment cycle, all cards will be declined, and manual expenses that require reimbursement will default to being repaid via payroll.\n\nWe understand that certain purchases or even large events can quickly deplete your available funds. To ensure your employees will have funds for their travel and expense needs, we recommend making a payment in advance of a particular purchase or event that will greatly impact your spend limit. Depending on the method of payment and issuing currency, manual payments may take several business days to process. Manual payments can be made at any time, including prior to your payment due date. To learn more about initiating a manual payment, see this article.\n\nIf your company is consistently exceeding the spend limit in a given statement period, our team can assess the possibility of increasing your company's limit.

    "body": "Resuming Travel in Today's Climate\nOptimizing your travel program for Duty of Care & Cost-Control\nAs COVID-19 vaccination efforts around the globe continue to gain momentum, travel resumption has also accelerated. For companies who are considering getting employees back to travel, duty of care, safety, and cost-control are likely to be top of mind. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, TripActions has committed to developing enhanced safety features that leverage modern technology, data from official health sources, and our relationships with airline and hotel partners to provide travel managers and travelers with industry-leading safety insights and functionality. Below we will share how you can leverage these features to resume travel for your company with confidence, as well as general best practices for managing travel in today's climate. Additionally, we encourage you to review our article on Best Practices for Booking in Today's Climate to learn more about how we are helping travelers make safe and informed choices.\nTravel Resumption Framework\nAt TripActions, we are equally committed to the safe and thoughtful resumption of travel for our own organization. Over the course of the last year, we have collaborated internally with our own staff, with our trusted hotel and air partners, as well as with clients of various sizes and across numerous industries, to establish a framework for safely resuming and managing business travel in today's new reality. This framework is composed of four main components: Plan, Monitor, Respond, and Report. Each component plays a unique and crucial role in the travel resumption process.\nTo centralize the task of planning for travel resumption and ensure all relevant stakeholders are involved, many organizations including TripActions have formed an internal COVID-19 task force. This task force is responsible for managing all return to office and travel policies and logistics and is typically made up of members from real estate and facilities teams, as well as legal, HR, and finance.\nThe rest of this article provides guidance for your travel program administrators and/or your COVID-19 task force on each area of the travel resumption framework, and highlights which TripActions features can be leveraged in each step of the process.\nPlan\nIn the planning stage of the travel resumption framework, program managers will focus on adapting the company's travel policies and trip approval process to account for current conditions and new business objectives. Program managers will also work within their organization to ensure that all business travel is booked in the TripActions platform, to ensure full visibility and optimal cost-control.\nAdapting Policy: When reviewing your travel policy, you may want to take into account different needs by region, or by department. For example, you may consider only resuming domestic travel to start by leveraging the Destination Settings within the Policy section of the Admin Dashboard to implement regional travel restrictions. Additionally, you may wish to permit or restrict certain travelers from booking, which can be easily done by grouping travelers into unique policy levels and defining the booking parameters of each level.\nFor our Liquid Expense™ customers, we recommend adapting your expense policies to reflect any recent updates to your company's budget. Your Liquid expense policies can be modified at any time, and will take effect immediately, ensuring that employees adhere to updated budgets and spend criteria.\nIncreasing Visibility: In today's climate, it is more important than ever to have full visibility into all employee travel so that your organization can best manage spend and ensure duty of care. In addition to mandating that all business travel be booked on the TripActions platform, there are several mechanisms for increasing travel visibility. These include copying a traveler's manager on all bookings, or adding a centralized email to be copied on all travel bookings (i.e. a Finance or HR monitored email alias). For more details on how you can increase visibility on bookings, please see this article.\nFor a final layer of visibility, you may also choose to enable the Trip Proposals feature when you first resume travel. The Trip Proposals functionality provides a seamless approval process for travelers to submit an itinerary to their manager for review and approval prior to making a booking. This allows team and department managers to gain visibility into their team's travel, and also helps support wider company initiatives around duty of care and cost-control.\nManager & Traveler Enablement: To ensure that the different members across your organization are enabled to resume travel themselves, or oversee the resumption of travel for others, we recommend providing additional training and resources on TripActions travel resumption tools to both travelers and managers:\nDriving Adoption: Once you have adapted your policies and approval workflows, you will want to take the next critical step of ensuring that all business travel is booked on the TripActions platform. High platform adoption ensures duty of care throughout your entire organization, and allows for additional cost savings by automating the process of leveraging unused airline credits when booking future travel. We recommend designating a member of your C-Suite to deliver an additional announcement to your team via your preferred communications channel, letting your organization know that all business travel should be booked on the TripActions platform.\nMonitor\nOnce travel has started to resume for your organization, you will want to ensure that all relevant individuals and teams at your company are enabled on how to monitor developments surrounding COVID-19 infection rates, leverage TripActions' new safety features, and review team or department travel.\nImpact Assessment: We recommend that your company's COVID-19 task force and/or travel program administrators monitor global COVID-19 developments on a daily basis, to ensure that you remain up to date and adapt travel and return to office policies as needed.\nTracking & Communication: The Active Traveler Map allows program administrators to see a 24-hour look back as well as a 24-hour look-ahead of active travelers' locations. We recommend regularly reviewing this map so you can identify travelers who may have recently come from, are currently in, or have plans to travel to a COVID-19 hotspot. Additionally, traveler contact information is readily available directly on the Active Traveler Map page so that you can easily communicate to travelers in the case of an emergency or other critical event.\nRespond\nBy closely monitoring travel requests, bookings, and leveraging the duty of care features outlined in this article, your team will be able to make quick and effective adaptations to your travel program in response to additional changes to the travel climate. These adaptations may include tweaking travel policies or managing return to office requirements for employees that have recently traveled.\nAd-hoc Policy Adjustments: Your team can gain insights from TripActions reporting and duty of care features to quickly make adjustments to policy, including travel permissions and restrictions, as well as booking visibility and workflows. Information on how you can make these changes on the platform can be found in the articles linked above in the Updating Policy section.\nReturn to Office Requirements: For companies looking to reopen their offices, we recommend implementing clear guidelines and protocols to ensure everyone's safety. This includes establishing a policy for health screening upon entering an office, with additional screening or office entry limitations for any employees that have recently traveled.\nBy closely monitoring your active travelers in the COVID-19 dashboard, you will be able to provide guidance on how and when recent travelers can return to the office following a business trip. Travelers who have been to destinations where COVID-19 rates and infections are high or increasing are advised to work remotely for a minimum of 14 days following their travel, and abide by any office requirements prior to returning to the office. These measures will help keep your employees safe and confident that the company has their best interests in mind as well as their colleagues'.\nCommunication to Travelers: Once you have made adjustments to your travel policy, workflow approvals, or post-travel return to office guidelines, you can leverage the Company Banner to prominently display any updates on the TripActions homepage to your travelers. Additionally, you can use this space to link out to an external document with more detailed information on your company's travel resumption guidelines.\nReport\nThe last component of the travel resumption framework ensures that you and your teams have access to the information required to iterate on your return to travel plan. TripActions provides this information through our on-demand reporting tools, which include unused credit utilization, traveler reporting, spend analysis, and more.\nUnused Credits: With so much travel cancelled in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, companies are seeing an unprecedented amount of unused flight credits, some totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. A recent analysis of TripActions data indicates that the expiration dates for many of these credits is approaching; of the unused flight credits in TripActions’ database as of February 2021, 55% of credits are due to expire in 2021 and 45% will expire in 2022. With this in mind, it is critical that unused ticket funds are utilized whenever possible once travel resumes and new flights are being booked. To learn how you can make the most of your organization's unused flight credits, see this article.\nTraveler Tracking: Traveler tracking and reporting will allow for swift action to be taken in the event of an emergency or other critical event. To monitor travel activity, admins can leverage the Active Traveler Map; you may also consider granting partial admin access to others in your organization who you would like to conduct additional monitoring.\nCost Management: When planning for travel resumption, controlling travel and expense costs are important factors to consider. TripActions provides on-demand reporting for finance teams, travel program managers, as well as team or department managers. For travel program managers or those in finance, we recommend leveraging the Analysis Section of the Admin Dashboard for a real-time view into T&E spend. The data in the analysis tool can be filtered by destination, region, department, cost center, and more. Regularly reviewing T&E data will help your team uncover opportunities for additional savings and efficiencies, and may also signal when it is time to make additional adjustments to your travel and expense policies.",

    "body": "Booking with Confidence in Today's Climate\nAs COVID-19 vaccination efforts around the globe continue to gain momentum, travel resumption has also accelerated. For those who are considering getting back to travel, safety is a top priority. From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, TripActions has committed to developing enhanced safety features that leverage modern technology, data from official health resources, and our relationships with airlines and hotel partners to provide travelers with industry-leading safety insights and functionality.

From the flight search results page, select a fare and scroll through through the images to find health and safety information that can help you make the most informed booking choice. The information available varies by airline, but typically addresses topics such as cleaning protocols and hygiene standards, health screenings, seat spacing, flight change and cancelation rules, and other relevant measures implemented by the airline.\nCOVID-19 Insights: Once you have selected your desired flight(s), you will have the opportunity to review COVID-19 reproduction rates for each step of your journey, including local restrictions, as well as the CDC alert level.

If you have any unused flight credits, we encourage you to utilize them before their expiration date to book future flights whenever possible. Using existing flight credits in TripActions is an easy, automated process and can save your company money on flight expenses.\nTraveling with confidence: Hotels\nWhen considering lodging options, we recommend reviewing property hygiene information as well as COVID-19 details for the location of your stay prior to making a booking.\nProperty Hygiene Information: This information is available for most properties on the TripActions platform and can be viewed from the hotel search results page. Property hygiene information includes details such as cleaning protocols, official sanitization certifications, social distancing guidelines, and hygiene-related offerings (i.e. complimentary masks or sanitizer in all rooms).

To find out how you can connect your calendar in a few easy steps, please read below.\nEnabling the Integration\nUnder your Traveler Profile in TripActions, click on Calendar & email sync. When using Google or Outlook Calendar, TripActions is able to automatically detect your system provider based on your email domain. Ensure that the correct provider has been detected and select Allow calendar access to proceed.\nYou will then be asked to Choose an account to sync with and Allow the sync. An example of these steps for Google calendar is shown below:\nNote: If you book a trip and do not already have a calendar integration enabled, a pop-up will appear asking you if you would like to add the trip to your calendar.

    "body": "\nBooking Travel for a Personal Guest\nTripActions allows you to easily book travel for personal guests, such as family or friends, by setting up a guest profile and adding the traveler to your booking. Read below to learn more. \n\n\nCreating a Guest Profile\nIn order to make bookings in TripActions on behalf of a personal guest, you will first need to create a guest profile for the individual. For instructions on how you can create guest profiles, see this article. \n \n\nMaking a Booking\nFlights\nTo book a flight for a personal guest, add their guest profile to your flight search and proceed with your booking as you typically would. Both you and your guest will be included on the same booking ID for easy management of your flight. Note: If you would like to book a flight for a child under the age of two, please contact our Travel Experience Team for assistance. \n\nHotels\nTo book a hotel for a personal guest, add their guest profile to your hotel search and proceed with your booking as you typically would. If your booking requires multiple hotel rooms, you will only be able to book multiples of the same room type (i.e. Standard Queen, Junior Suite, etc.); to book different room types, you will want to book for each traveler separately, one room at a time. Each room will have a unique booking confirmation number in order to separate the room reservations. Additionally, please note that all hotel bookings require that at least one person over the age of 18 be included on the reservation. \n\nCars\nCar rental bookings only allow for a single traveler to be added to the Travelers section of your search. You may reserve a car on behalf of a friend or family member by removing your name under the Travelers section, and adding the name of the guest who will be picking up and driving the vehicle. Please note that most car rental agencies have a minimum age requirement of 25 to pick up and drive a rental vehicle. \n\nTrains\nTo book a train for a personal guest, add their guest profile to your train search and proceed with your booking as you typically would. Both you and your guest will be included on the same booking ID and will therefore be on the same ticket; we recommend that whenever possible, you and your guest remain together for the duration of the train travel. If this is not possible, separate bookings should be made for each traveler or for each grouping of travelers that will remain together (in the case of multiple guests). \n \n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: How many people can I book for at one time?\nA: The maximum for each booking type is:\n\nFlights: Eight people on one booking\nHotels: Eight people and four rooms in one booking\nCars: Only the booker can be included on the booking\nTrains: Between five and nine people, depending on the carrier\n\nQ: Can I book for a guest without being on the trip myself? \nA: Yes, you can create a booking for just family or friends by removing yourself from the Travelers section of the search page. \n\nQ: Is there a fee to book travel for my friends or family?\nA: No, there is no fee to book personal travel in TripActions, whether that is for yourself or for others.\n\nQ: My guest already has a TripActions account through their own employer; will I be able to access that account to book for them?  \nA: No, profiles created under another company's corporate TripActions account will not be accessible by a different company. To book for this type of guest, you will need to create a new guest traveler profile and ensure that this profile does not utilize the business or personal email address that the guest is currently using in TripActions under their company's account; a different email address will need to be input for the guest. \n\nQ: Am I able to use different forms of payment when booking for multiple people?\nA: No, only one form of payment may be used per transaction. To book using different forms of payment, you will need to conduct individual searches and make bookings separately. \n\nQ: What types of booking notifications/confirmations will my guest(s) receive? \nA: For information about the types of booking confirmations and notifications your guest may receive, view this article. \n\nQ: How can I cancel a booking under a guest's name? \nA: Bookings under a guest's name can be changed or canceled in the following ways:\n\nThe Booker: For bookings made in a guest's name, reference the booking confirmation email for cancelation terms and conditions and contact a member of our Travel Experience team to modify the booking.\nYour Guest: Guests can use the links provided in the booking confirmation email to manage reservations in their name. This can be done by either contacting a member of the Travel Experience team or by creating a personal account in TripActions and using our self-serve change tools.",

    "body": "Earning and Redeeming TripActions Rewards\nThe TripActions Rewards program allows TripActions users to earn a variety of incentives for booking cost-effective business travel options. Incentives include Amazon gift cards, credits towards personal travel, and business travel upgrades. Read below to learn how you can earn, view, and redeem your rewards. \n\nNote: If your company has chosen to enroll in TripActions Rewards, you will see Rewards and a balance (i.e. Rewards $65) at the top of your booking homepage and a rewards tab in your profile. If you do not see this on your account, it's unlikely that rewards are enabled for your company; contact your company's travel manager for more information.\n \n\nEarning Rewards\nRewards are earned by making business-related hotel and car bookings below the optimal price for your location and dates. Follow these steps to start earning rewards: \n\nConduct any car or hotel search under Business in TripActions.\nAt the top of the search page, you will see either Price to beat to earn rewards (rental car searches) or Earn rewards by booking below $xxx (hotel searches).\nScroll through the search results or use the filter options to view only results that offer rewards.\nYou will see the reward amount listed to the right of each search result option. Click the amount to select that option and view additional details. \nHotel information will open in a new tab. Scroll to Filter your results to view only the rooms that offer rewards. \n \nPending and Earned Rewards\nPending Rewards: Immediately after a rewards-eligible booking is confirmed, rewards will display in your traveler profile as pending. Rewards that are pending cannot be redeemed until after the end date of the booking is in the past. Pending rewards are removed if the booking is canceled.\n\nEarned Rewards: Approximately 24-48 hours after the end date of the rewards eligible booking has passed, pending rewards will convert into earned rewards and become eligible for redemption. \n \n\nViewing and Redeeming Your Rewards\nView pending and earned rewards by visiting your TripActions traveler profile on the web or mobile app. Because rewards are earned for business travel and are company paid, gift cards and rewards communications will be sent to your work email address. \n\nNote: Redemption processing times may vary and take up to 72 hours depending on reward type and issuing currency. \n\nDesktop:\n\nNavigate to your Profile and click on Rewards \nChoose a reward type (Amazon Gift Card, Personal Travel, or Business Travel Upgrades) and select Redeem \nMake any additional selections based on redemption type\nimage.png\nMobile app: \n\nNavigate to your Profile and click on Your Rewards\nSwipe to select a rewards type and follow the steps to redeem\nMake any additional selections based on redemption type\n\nAfter completing all required steps, you will receive a confirmation that the request has been sent. Check your business email to view applicable redemption codes and instructions. \n\n Screen Shot 2021-03-11 at 5.27.46 PM.png\n \n\nAmazon Gift Cards\nIf you would like to redeem your rewards for an Amazon gift card, you will be asked to specify a redemption amount and your preferred Amazon online store. For example, if you prefer to shop on Amazon's France website, select France (amazon.fr) from the dropdown menu. All cards will be issued electronically and any currency differences will be automatically converted. Please note that processing times for Amazon gift cards will vary by issuing currency. Cards issued in USD will be processed in approximately one business day; cards issued in other currencies will be processed in 2-3 business days. \n \n\nScreen Shot 2021-03-11 at 5.25.13 PM.png\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Do earned rewards expire or depreciate in value?\nA: No, however, rewards are a company paid benefit and therefore can be altered at any time. Your company has the ability to remove rewards for a specific traveler or all travelers at their discretion. \n\nQ: Who is eligible to earn and redeem rewards?\nA: Rewards can be earned by employees of the company only. Company guests, individual account users, and disabled users are not eligible to earn or redeem rewards. \n\nQ: Is there a limit on the amount of rewards I can redeem at one time?\nA: There is a maximum of $2,000 per Amazon rewards redemption. Redemptions more than $2,000 must be split into multiple transactions. \n\nQ: How do rewards redeemed for personal travel work?\nA: Rewards redeemed for personal travel credit can be used to book travel for yourself or guests under the Personal travel section of your TripActions account. Please note that when booking personal travel using rewards, the reward amount earned must cover the entire cost of your booking; it is currently not possible to split the cost between rewards and another form of payment. If TripActions personal travel has not been enabled for your company, you will not see the option to redeem rewards for personal travel credits.\n\n",

The user will be notified by email, in-app, and via push notification (if enabled by the user) that their transaction has been partially or fully rejected for reimbursement. \n\nRequest More Information\nIf a manual transaction requires more information (i.e. explanation for overspending), admins can request it from the user directly in TripActions Liquid before approving or rejecting the transaction. After requesting additional information, the transaction will be moved to the Info requested tab of the Manual transactions page, and then back to the Flagged transactions tab after the user replies. Users will be notified via email and/or push notification and can see and take action on these transactions under the Info required section of their TripActions Liquid account. \n\nAdd Admin Note \nAdmins can add internal notes to any transaction by clicking Add admin note on the transaction detail page.

    "body": "Paying Your TripActions Liquid™ Statement balance\nTripActions Liquid Statements are issued by legal entity and associated currency (USD, GBP, EUR) on the 1st or 15th of each month for the prior month's spend. Statements balances must be paid in full each billing cycle and are due ten days after the statement is issued. Admins and account owners can make additional manual payments at any time to add funds during the billing cycle. Continue reading for instructions on how you can make payments, authorize a secondary payment approver, and manage low funds. \n \n\nPayments\nACH auto-pay \nACH auto-pay via Stripe is the standard payment method for USD statement balances. USD statements are available on the 1st or 15th of each month and payments will be automatically debited via ACH ten days after the statement is issued. If the payment falls on a weekend or a US bank holiday, the auto-debit will take place the following business day. To access ACH ID information for Stripe (our payment processing partner), click here. \n\nManual payments \nPayments for GBP and EUR statement balances must be manually initiated each statement period via a wire transfer from your bank (auto-pay and manual payments initiated via the TripActions Liquid platform are not currently available for GBP and EUR). Additionally, you may elect to make a manual payment to a USD statement balance in addition to your ACH auto-pay. Please note that ACH payments will take up to five business days from the date they are initiated to be reflected in your TripActions Liquid account. Follow the steps listed below to initiate a manual payment. \n\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Statements > Payments\nSelect the currency (if multiple are available) for which you would like to make a payment\nClick Make a manual payment to view payment instructions and available payment methods for each issuing currency \nimage.png ​​​\n \nSelect a Legal entity (if multiple are available) to view the amount due for that specific entity or select All legal entities to view the total outstanding balance for that issuing currency. If you do not have an outstanding balance and you anticipate your company needing additional funds for the month, you have the option to schedule an additional payment that will pay down your current month's balance. Important Note: Payments should be made by legal entity to ensure that the payment is applied to the correct entity. We are unable to split a lump sum payment between legal entities and cannot carry over funds from one legal entity to another. \nUSD payments: USD payments are made through ACH debits from the bank account linked to your USD Liquid account\nGBP payments: GBP payments are made by wire transfer and processed through BACS (Bankers Automated Clearing System)\nEUR payments: EUR payments are made by wire transfer and processed through SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area)\nNote: Payments must be made in the currency reflected on the statement. For example, a GBP statement balance can only be paid in GBP. \n\n \n\nSecondary Manual Payment Approval (available for USD payments only)\nFor an added layer of control and visibility over manual payments made in USD, you can require that another admin approve all manual payments. Navigate to Company > Settings and scroll to Manual payment approval. Click on Update manual payment settings to configure. When enabled, an email will be sent to all account admins (including the account owner), requesting that a secondary approver review the request and provide approval for the manual payment. If there is only one admin/account owner assigned to the company account, a second admin will need to be assigned before this feature can be utilized.\n\nScreen Shot 2021-08-27 at 4.48.26 PM.png\n \nLow Funds Alert\nIf your company is within 30% of your funding limit, all TripActions Liquid admins and account owners will receive an email notification with an estimate of how long the remaining funds will last, based on your company’s previous spending history. To make a payment to your TripActions Liquid account, click Add funds now from the notification email or login to the Liquid Dashboard. You can add additional funds by following the steps listed in the Payments section of this article. Please note that ACH payments will take up to five business days from the date they are initiated to be reflected in your TripActions Liquid account. Please refer to your bank's processing times for payments made in GBP and EUR. \n\nimage.png\n \nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: If I schedule a manual payment before my company's set auto-payment date (USD statements only), will it cancel the scheduled auto-debit payment?\nA: If a manual payment is initiated via ACH, scheduled auto payments will be canceled once the funds from the manual payment have settled and paid the statement balance in full (funds must settle and pay off the balance before the payment due date in order for auto payments to be canceled). We recommend initiating manual payments 5-10 days before you would like them to reflect on your statement balance; partial payments or payments made after the auto-pay due date will not cancel auto-pay. \n\nQ: What happens if two admins schedule payments for the same amount?\nA: USD Accounts: While payments are processing, two payments cannot be made for the exact same amount. However, multiple payments for different amounts can be made at any time. \nEUR and GBP Accounts: Since GBP and EUR payments are initiated via wire transfer directly from your bank, there are no limits placed by TripActions Liquid on the number or amount of payments initiated. \n\nQ: How long does a manual payment take to process before it becomes available?\nUSD Accounts: Manual payments initiated via the TripActions Liquid platform will take two to four business days from the time they are initiated to become available for use. Processing time for ACH or wire transfers initiated directly through your bank will vary based on your bank. \nEUR and GBP Accounts: Since GBP and EUR payments are initiated via wire transfer directly from your bank, the processing time will vary based on your bank. We recommend speaking with your bank to understand their processing times so you can ensure your TripActions Liquid account is funded on time. ",

    "body": "Visibility on Out-of-Policy Bookings\nEffectively managing out-of-policy bookings contributes to a successful travel program by providing insights into traveler behavior and spend. TripActions provides several options to manage out-of-policy bookings so that companies of all sizes have appropriate visibility and can take action. Continue reading to learn more.\n \n\nOut-of-Policy Approvers\nAn out-of-policy approver is a designated individual who is responsible for the review of any out-of-policy bookings made by travelers. Typically, a traveler's manager or the head of their department will be assigned as their approver. These individuals receive email notifications for their assigned travelers when out-of-policy bookings are made, with the option to cancel non-compliant bookings. Out-of-policy approvers have access to the TripActions Manager Dashboard, which provides a centralized view of all out-of-policy bookings that require attention.\n \n\nManaging Out-of-Policy Bookings\nOut-of-policy approvers can be set by any TripActions admin by utilizing the Manager or Traveler Approver fields on the User List in the Admin Dashboard (for details on how to configure users as out-of-policy approvers, see this article).\n\nAdmins will have the option to fill in one or both of these fields depending on their desired out-of-policy notification process. Below is an explanation of the workflow options. \n\nTraveler's manager to receive notifications on out-of-policy bookings: Ensure the Manager field is filled out with the appropriate manager's email. Note: If you have an HRIS sync enabled, manager information will automatically populate based on who is listed as each user's manager in your HRIS. \nTraveler approver to receive notifications on out-of-policy bookings: Ensure the Traveler Approver field is filled in with the appropriate approver's email. \nFor more information about the difference between a manager and travel approver, and the implications of using one or both fields, see this article. \n\nTip: Inform travel approvers of their role in advance and set clear expectations on how and when they should take action on out-of-policy bookings. For detailed information on how managers and traveler approvers can best manage their team's out-of-policy bookings, please see this article. \n\n\nAdditional Options and Exceptions\nBackup Approver\nIf you would like to create additional visibility around out-of-policy bookings, consider enabling the Backup Approvers feature. Backup approvers will be cc'd on all out-of-policy bookings for your company. To enable this feature, navigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Settings and scroll to the Backup emails for out-of-policy approvals section. To add multiple emails, simply separate each entry with a comma. Note: Backup approvers will receive notifications for all out-of-policy bookings but will not have the ability to cancel a booking on behalf of the booker. \n\nOverride Booking Approver\nIf you would like to override the default approver for certain out-of-policy bookings, you can utilize the Override Booking Approver feature. For more information, see this article. \n\nBooking Approval for Team Travel Events\nNotifications for out-of-policy bookings made via a Team Travel event invite will be sent to the event organizer and not the default approver for the traveler. For more information on Team Travel and policy, see this article. ",

    "body": "Making the Most of Your Top Routes Data\nTravel | Book > Travel | Admin > Dashboard > Booking type metrics > Flights > Top routes\n\nYour company's Top Routes data represents the flight routes most frequently booked by your travelers. Below, we'll review how you can use your top routes data to better understand and optimize your travel program. \n \n\nUsing Top Routes Data to Ensure Platform Adherence\nHigh platform adoption is a top indicator of a successful and financially beneficial travel program. Looking at your top routes data can help you to identify gaps in adoption, such as underutilization of the platform by certain teams or departments. \n\nTypically your top office and client locations will appear in your top routes. An absence of them on your list may indicate adoption issues. For example, if you know that your Customer Success team makes frequent trips to New York City where you have a large client base, but your top routes do not include travel from one of your office locations to New York City, you may have identified an adoption issue within your Customer Success organization. From here, you can work directly with your Customer Success team to encourage platform adherence and increase adoption. \n \n\nUsing Top Routes Data to Optimize your Travel Policies\nYou can also use the top routes data to help you increase cost control and set more effective travel policies by looking at the average flight price next to each route. For example, if LAX to SFO is one of your top routes and has an average flight per price of $305, you can set a route-specific flight policy of about $305 for your travelers. This will guide your travelers towards consistently booking as close to the average price for your company as possible when selecting this route. \n \n\nOther Recommendations\nHotel Recommendations\nMark specific hotels as company preferred in TripActions so that travelers know to consider them when making a booking. To ensure that your recommended hotels are cost-effective, you can suggest properties that are part of the TripActions Lodging Collection, which offers special discounted rates to all TripActions customers. To see a list of these properties, conduct a hotel search for the locations in your top routes, and filter the search by 'TripActions Lodging Collection' (Filters > More > Discounted Rates > TripActions Lodging Collection). \n\nOffice Guides\nCreate an office guide to share tips on local transportation, suggested dining options, and other local attractions to ensure your travelers have a great experience when traveling for business.

    "body": "Making the Most of Your Top Airlines Data\nTravel | Book > Travel | Admin > Dashboard > Booking Type Metrics > Flights > Top Airlines\n\nOne of the top benefits of managing your company's corporate travel in a single platform is the ability to track and leverage company spend to yield additional savings, as well as traveler perks. Depending on the annualized spend per airline, your company may be eligible for a corporate rewards program, or for a corporate airline discount. Below is an overview of how you can best leverage the top airline data in the Admin Dashboard to seek out savings and benefits opportunities. \n \n\nCorporate Discounts \nBy looking at the top airlines booked by your employees in a given period, you can project your company's annualized spend and assess whether you may be eligible for a corporate airline discount. While eligibility requirements vary by carrier, most airlines will provide discounted corporate fares to companies whose annualized spend meets or exceeds $1.2 million. To learn more about corporate air programs and eligibility, see this article.\n \n\nCorporate Loyalty Programs \nIf your company does not meet the eligibility requirements for a corporate airline discount, we recommend enrolling in your top airlines' corporate loyalty programs. These programs provide added benefits to your travelers, such as free name changes and complimentary upgrades, and are quick and easy to enroll in. To learn more about corporate loyalty programs, see this article.\n \n\nOther Considerations\nIf your company is looking to increase overall spend with a particular airline to yield stronger savings opportunities, it is important to align traveler behavior with company goals. This may include encouraging your employees to book air travel with specific airlines, especially when planning large events which can result in significant bulk spend (such as a Sales Kickoff or President's Club trips). \n\nLastly, it is important to understand different airline alliances, so that you can look at spend for partner airlines collectively. For example, your company's spend with Delta Airlines may only amount to about $500,000 on average per year, but if your company is also spending a significant amount on Delta's partner airlines such as KLM, Air France, or Virgin Atlantic, your overall spend may make you eligible for a corporate relationship.

    "body": "Understanding Cabin Class Flight Metrics\nWhen designing corporate travel policies, a top consideration for companies is the level of flexibility given to travelers when selecting a cabin class for air travel. Company culture typically plays a significant role in making this determination; some companies opt for a \"traveler first\" approach and are less restrictive, whereas others are more budget conscious and elect a less flexible \"Economy only\" approach. Below are suggested considerations to help you establish a well-balanced policy for your company. \n \n\nTraveler Category\nLooking at employee hierarchy is a common method for creating cabin class policies. Many companies will choose to provide their director or executive level staff with the ability to book more comfortable air travel in a higher cabin class.  \n \n\nFrequency of Travel\nEmployees who spend a lot of time traveling are often sacrificing personal time and may also need to work longer hours due to time lost in transit. Many companies prioritize comfort for these frequent travelers and allow them to book a higher cabin class as a mechanism for ensuring employee satisfaction. If your company has a high amount of frequent travelers and allowing for higher cabin class bookings becomes too expensive, you may also consider less costly alternatives to increasing traveler satisfaction, such as allowing extra legroom seating in lieu of a premium cabin. \n \n\nType of Travel\nThe type of travel, often defined as domestic or international, is another key factor to consider when reviewing cabin class policies. Additionally, some companies look at the total flight time to decide if a more flexible or higher cabin class policy should apply. For example, it is common to allow a higher cabin class on overnight flights where the traveler may need to go from the airport directly to a client meeting. Once again, it is important to monitor the cost associated with these policies and adjust accordingly to balance company culture and spend. \n \n\nCost Implications of Higher Cabin Classes \nBy looking at booking data for all TripActions customers, we can see below just how drastic the price difference can be between cabins. The below graph represents the average ticket price for a roundtrip flight, from New York to London. Given the high price of Business and First Class in comparison to Economy and Premium Economy, shifting the cabin class on a couple of tickets would result in tens of thousands of dollars in savings.\n\n\n \nWe encourage customers to keep a close eye on their cabin class policies and adjust according to the company budget or when savings are of particular importance.",

    "body": "Improving Your Company's Flight Spend Metrics\nTravel | Book > Travel | Admin > Dashboard > Booking type metrics > Flights\n\nYour company's flight spend metrics are directly correlated to the air travel policies you have set for your travelers. Understanding how these metrics can be influenced by your existing policy will help you to implement the right changes to drive additional savings.\n \n\nAdjusting Lead Time to Increase Savings\nFlight pricing is determined by available inventory, which typically correlates directly with how far in advance a flight is purchased. Most domestic US carriers also have pricing models which change at the 3, 7, 14, and 21-day mark. Typically, the further in advance a booking is made, the cheaper it will be. For corporate travel, we find that an ideal booking lead time is between 14 to 21 days. \n\nCompare this ideal range to the average lead time you are seeing on your dashboard and measure it against how your policy is set. In order to encourage travelers to book flights further in advance, it may be worth ensuring your policy is in line with your company's end goal. If the average booking lead time for your travelers is 7 days, setting an unrealistic lead time of 14 or 21 days may lead to traveler frustration; instead, you can increase in increments and work up to a longer lead time. It is also important to understand why certain travelers or departments are booking with minimal lead time so that you are able to distinguish between addressable behaviors and legitimate business reasons for last-minute bookings. \n \n\nFor example...\nLet's take a look at a real-life example of how adjusting your lead time policy can positively impact your flight metrics. The below graph represents the average Economy roundtrip ticket price for flights from SFO to JFK across all TripActions customers.\n\nThe average ticket price for a flight booked between 7 to 14 days in advance instead of 7 or fewer days in advance results in a 20% price decrease.\nThe average ticket price for a flight booked 14+ days in advance instead of 7 to 14 days in advance results in a 14% price decrease.\nMultiply these incremental savings by the number of tickets purchased at your company in a given year, and you will see just how substantial the potential for additional savings can be by shifting behavior and encouraging flight purchases further in advance.",

    "body": "Understanding and Improving Traveler Satisfaction\nTravel | Book > Travel | Admin > Dashboard > Satisfaction\n\nUnderstanding and responding to the sentiment of your travelers towards your travel booking tool is an important component of a successful program. High traveler satisfaction typically leads to higher program adoption and adherence, which contributes to Duty of Care efforts and creates increased savings opportunities. As part of our commitment to transparency, we provide program administrators with insights into what your travelers are saying about TripActions. \n\n\nHow TripActions Measures User Satisfaction\nTripActions leverages the Net Promoter Score (NPS) model to measure traveler satisfaction. The NPS model utilizes a short satisfaction survey sent by TripActions to travelers post-booking and post-trip, asking them how likely they are to recommend TripActions to a friend or colleague on a scale of 0 to 10. A 9 or 10 rating is considered a Promoter, a 7 or 8 rating is considered Passive, and anything 6 or below is considered a Detractor.\n\nYour company's NPS rating for TripActions is calculated by subtracting the percentage of your travelers who are detractors from the percentage who are promoters. Additionally, we provide travelers with the opportunity to explain their rating. This feedback is monitored by our Customer Success and Product teams so we can identify areas of improvement and opportunities for additional traveler training. \n\n\n \nWhat is considered a good NPS and what impacts it?\nAt TripActions, we consider a great NPS rating from customers (company) to be any figure above 30, and a stellar NPS to be anything above 40.\n\nWhen assessing your company's NPS rating for TripActions, there are a number of factors to consider, including:\n\nHow new your company is to TripActions: We typically see NPS ratings increase gradually as employees get more familiar with the platform and adjust to any associated changes (such as new travel policies). \nYour company's change management methods and overall culture: How your organization typically responds to change and what change management style was applied to the roll-out of TripActions will typically have an effect on how your travelers respond to and feel about the platform. \n\nImproving NPS\nOur Customer Success, Traveler Experience (Support), and Product Teams are committed to monitoring and reacting to trends in our NPS, so that we can continue to improve our product and offerings to meet customer needs.\n\nAdditionally, below are a few suggestions on what you can do to drive higher traveler satisfaction among your travelers: \n\nConduct an internal survey to gain a deeper understanding of how your traveler base is feeling to identify any addressable themes in sentiment. \nConnect with those who left an NPS and ask them to elaborate on what is working well and where there may be opportunities for improvement. Gaining additional context will help discern actual issues from one-off complaints. ",

The number one way to minimize missed savings and encourage travelers to book closely to fair market pricing is to rely on the TripActions dynamic policy. \n \n\nWhat is the dynamic policy and how does it help increase savings?\nThe TripActions dynamic policy is a unique way to optimize your company's savings by providing your travelers with a benchmark for a fair price based on the market prices for their destination and travel dates. \n\nAs an example of the dynamic policy in action, let's think about booking travel to San Francisco, a city home to many large events, such as Salesforce's Dreamforce. These types of events tend to cause significant fluctuation in pricing for both flights and hotels. If a static price cap is presented to travelers, many will adopt an \"I can spend up to...\" mindset. This means that in cases where the fair market price is lower than the price cap, many travelers will still choose to ignore the fair market price displayed to them and spend the full amount allotted to them by their company's policy since those bookings are technically policy compliant. Alternatively, if a dynamic policy is used, travelers will concentrate on the fair market price as their booking benchmark and be far less likely to overspend. \n\n\nFor more information regarding best practices for setting policies, please review this article.

Out-of-policy bookings are defined as any booking that violates your company's travel policies and are tracked by lead time (how far in advance bookings are made) and price (overspending on a booking). Typically, our customers configure their out-of-policy logic to alert a designated approver when a policy has been violated so that the approver can choose to approve or decline the booking. Continue reading to learn more about how you can better understand and reduce your company's out-of-policy bookings. \n \n\nUncovering Themes\nTo determine the top out-of-policy reasons specific to your company, you will want to pull a booking report from the Admin Dashboard. This report will showcase why bookings were marked as out-of-policy by department or individual, as well as the reasons indicated by your travelers for violating policy (i.e. \"I had to attend a last-minute client meeting\"). Based on your analysis of this report, you should be able to determine if your company falls under one of the following two scenarios: \n\nYour current policies are too restrictive and/or not reflective of the nature of your company's travel (or the nature of a specific department's travel).\nYour current policies are reflective of the nature of your company's/department's travel, but your travelers are choosing to not be compliant with the policy.\nIf the second scenario was most in-line with your findings, we recommend speaking with some of the teams or individuals that most frequently make out-of-policy bookings, to gain insights on the choices they're making and why. If the first scenario was more relevant, we recommend fine-tuning your policies. Additionally, you may want to consider adjusting your policy grouping in order to increase booking flexibility (i.e. if your company policy requires a 14-day lead time but a 7-day lead time is more realistic for your Sales Team). \n \n\nDecreasing Out-of-Policy Bookings\nLeverage the Manager Dashboard \nEncourage booking approvers to use the TripActions Manager Dashboard to actively monitor out-of-policy bookings, take control of their team or department's budget, and encourage compliant bookings. \n\nUtilize Additional Approvers\nAdd another user to oversee all out-of-policy bookings. Learn how here. \n\nCreate a Travel Policy Slack Channel or Email Alias\nDedicate a Slack channel or email alias to addressing your travelers' questions or feedback surrounding your company's booking policies.

Typically, Top Locations will include the areas where your company has major offices or areas where you have a large client base. Below we will dive into how you can use your Top Locations data to better understand and optimize your travel program. \n\n \nUsing Top Locations Data to Ensure Platform Adherence\nAs outlined in this article, high platform adoption is a top indicator of a successful and financially beneficial travel program. Looking at your Top Locations data can help you to identify gaps in adoption, such as underutilization of the platform by certain teams or departments. \n\nSince we know that your top office and client locations should typically appear in your Top Locations, an absence of their presence on your list may indicate adoption issues. For example, if you know that your Customer Success team makes frequent trips to New York City where you have a large client base, but New York City is not included as one of your Top Locations, you may have identified an adoption issue within your Customer Success organization. From here, you can work directly with your Customer Success team to encourage platform adherence and increase adoption. For tips on how to increase adoption, see this article. \n\n \nUsing Top Locations Data to Optimize your Travel Policies\nYou can also use the Top Locations data to help you increase cost-control and set more effective travel policies by looking at the average rate per night next to each location. For example, if London is one of your Top Locations and has an average nightly rate of $250, you can set a city-specific hotel policy at or slightly above $250 for your travelers. This will guide your travelers towards consistently booking as close to the average price for your company as possible when staying in this city. \n \n\nOther Recommendations\nRecommend preferred hotels located in the cities your travelers visit most frequently. To ensure that your recommended hotels are also cost-effective, you can suggest properties that are part of the TripActions Lodging Collection, which offers special discounted rates to all TripActions customers. To see a list of these properties, conduct a hotel search for the cities in your Top Locations and filter the search by 'TripActions Lodging Collection' (Filters > More > Discounted Rates > TripActions Lodging Collection). \nIf not already enabled for your company, consider turning on TripActions Rewards for your travelers. The TripActions rewards program incentivizes travelers to make cost-conscious booking choices by allowing them to receive a portion of the company savings.",

Corporate loyalty programs typically offer discounts and additional perks and can be stored in your company's TripActions account for your travelers to easily use. \n\nTripActions Rewards\nIf not already enabled for your company, consider turning on TripActions Rewards. The TripActions rewards program incentivizes travelers to make cost-conscious booking choices by allowing them to receive a portion of the company savings. \n\nLocation\nEncourage your travelers to check the prices of different pick-up and drop-off locations when selecting a rental car; prices can often increase significantly for airport pick-up locations as well as when the pick-up and drop-off locations are different. \n\n\nFor more information regarding best practices for setting policies, view this article.

    "body": "Improving Your Company's Hotel Spend Metrics\nTravel | Book > Travel | Admin > Dashboard > Booking type metrics > Hotels\n\nYour company's hotel spend metrics are directly correlated to the hotel policies you have set for your travelers. Understanding how these metrics can be influenced by your existing policy will help you to implement the right changes to drive additional savings. Additionally, encouraging your travelers to utilize the TripActions Lodging Collection, which offers discounted rates to all TripActions customers, can drive a significant increase in hotel savings. \n \n\nThe TripActions Lodging Collection\nBy leveraging the size and growth of TripActions' global traveler base, we have secured highly competitive rates which include special amenities at business traveler-friendly properties in major markets around the world. These special rates are part of the TripActions Lodging Collection and are available to all TripActions customers. \n\nEncourage your travelers to seek out bookings from the TripActions Lodging Collection by filtering their hotel searches for these properties (Filters > More > Discounted rates > TripActions Lodging Collection).\n \n\nSetting a Dynamic Policy\nThe TripActions dynamic policy is a unique way to optimize your company's savings by providing your travelers with a benchmark for a fair price based on the market prices for their destination and travel dates.\n\nAs an example of the dynamic policy in action, let's think about booking a hotel in San Francisco; a city that is home to many large events, such as Salesforce's Dreamforce. These types of events tend to cause significant fluctuation in hotel pricing. In the case that a static hotel price cap is presented to travelers, many will adopt an \"I can spend up to...\" mindset. This means that in cases where the fair market price is lower than the price cap, many travelers will still choose to ignore the fair market price displayed to them and spend the full amount allotted to them by their company's policy, since those bookings are technically policy compliant. Alternatively, if a dynamic policy is used, travelers will concentrate on the fair market price as their booking benchmark, and be far less likely to overspend. \n \n\nOther Recommendations\nRoom cancelation policy\nRooms with less flexible cancelation terms are often the least expensive. Consider encouraging your travelers to book non-refundable rooms when they feel confident that the itinerary for their trip will not need to change or be canceled.  \n\nBooking lead time\nUnlike flight bookings, hotel prices often decrease closer to the arrival date. Evaluate your company's lead time policy for hotels and consider decreasing your booking lead time.  \n\nTripActions Rewards\nIf not already enabled for your company, consider turning on TripActions Rewards. The TripActions rewards program incentivizes travelers to make cost-conscious booking choices by allowing them to receive a portion of the company savings. \n \n\nFor more information about best practices for setting policies, view this article.

While TripActions does not currently provide insurance for bookings made on our platform, there are a myriad of options that may be available to travelers and their companies. Some examples include: \n\nTripActions Liquid™ Customers\nTripActions Liquid card users have access to travel and emergency assistance services provided by Visa. These services are designed to help travelers, their immediate family members, and business associates in case of emergency when traveling. For detailed information about the services provided by Visa, view their Commercial Card Benefits page.\n\nBattleface Insurance Provider\nTripActions has partnered with the customizable travel insurance provider battleface, to offer TripActions users flexible trip coverage. Battleface allows travelers to easily select and customize the best insurance coverage for their unique trip. The process is simple and can include additional options such as Trip Cancellation, COVID-19 Coverage, Emergency Assistance, Cancel for Any Reason, and more. Access via this link for an exclusive offer of VIP Customer Service and extended rental car damage coverage.\n\nCredit Card Provider Coverage\nMost major credit cards include a level of insurance for travel bookings made on their card. Credit cards often provide coverage for car rentals, lost luggage, flight cancelations, hotel cancelations, and medical disruptions. Check with your credit card provider to learn what options may be available to you. \n\nRegional Specific Coverage\nTravel insurance may already be in place when traveling within specific regions. For example, the European Union, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland have established common rules to provide compensation and assistance to travelers in the event of denied boarding, flight cancelations, or long flight delays. For more information about this coverage specifically, see EU 261 regulations or visit your airline provider's website. \n\nAirline Provider Coverage\nMany airlines partner with major insurance providers to offer travelers trip coverage for non-refundable airline tickets, hotel reservations, and car rentals. Insurance plans may include compensation for unexpected illnesses, missed connections, weather cancelations and delays, lost or damaged luggage, and more. Check with your airline provider to learn more about the options they provide. \n\nCompany Provided Coverage\nMany insurance providers partner with companies to offer insurance coverage to travelers. Medjet is a TripActions preferred provider that offers top-rated global medical transport, travel security and insurance, crisis response, and COVID-19 emergency transport services for TripActions customers at an exclusive discounted rate.

It may be worth negotiating status matching into your contract to encourage your top travelers to make the change.\nROI: Look into your company's historical spend with each airline to begin calculating a potential savings amount.\nIf you are interested in a corporate airline contract, contact your Customer Success Manager.

CNRs for hotels have many benefits including an improved traveler experience, additional amenities and perks, and of course, savings. The process of negotiating and maintaining corporate rates can be complex and time-consuming, so it is important to focus efforts in areas where you will see the greatest savings potential. \n \n\nCNR Considerations\nEligibility: A minimum annual commitment of 100 nights is a common threshold for being in a good position to negotiate a CNR. \nFor major cities such as San Francisco, New York, or London, the minimum commitment is typically around 250 nights annually. \nLoyalty: Consider whether you can motivate your travelers to book at a company preferred property versus booking according to their own personal preferences. If your company is enrolled in the TripActions Rewards Program, you will also want to consider traveler behavior around selecting rooms eligible for rewards versus rooms with a CNR; we have found that the TripActions Rewards program tends to save, on average, more than than the average CNR. \n​​​​​​​ROI: CNRs are often 10% off of the best available rate; you may also be able to negotiate add-on services such as free wifi or complimentary breakfast as part of your discount.  Additionally, you will want to consider the discounted rates already offered directly TripActions before pursuing your own rates:\nThird-Party Inventory: In addition to direct from hotel rates, TripActions also offers third-party inventory from consumer sites.

    "body": "Office Locations and Legal Entities in TripActions\nEnsuring that your organization has properly configured its office locations, legal entities, and attributed employees accordingly is an important part of the implementation process for both TripActions Travel and TripActions Liquid™. Proper configuration of this information ensures that each booking made in TripActions is accurately recorded and that expenses are compliant with various legal and tax requirements. \n \n\nSetting up Offices and Legal Entities\nOffices and legal entities are configured separately in TripActions, allowing several office locations to share the same legal entity. Offices and legal entities serve the following purposes: \n\nOffices are used to categorize travelers by specific company locations or workspaces\nLegal entities (also referred to as billing entities) are associated with legal and tax information used for invoicing and appear on TripActions summary of charges. Legal entities also determine the issuing currency assigned to cards for our TripActions Liquid TripActions Liquid™ customers.

Begin by navigating to Travel | Book > Company | Configuration > Users, or by clicking on the ellipsis menu (three dots) next to +Add office and selecting Assign users. Proceed with one of the following options: \n\nAssign directly in the user list: Use the Search bar to find the user you would like to update.

Click on the desired office to update and save. See this article for more information. \nAssign via file upload: For bulk updates, you can use the Upload and Download buttons in the Users tab. Make changes by downloading your entire user list, updating in excel, and then uploading back to TripActions. See this article for more information. \nAssign via HRIS integration: If your company has an HRIS integration/sync enabled and offices have been assigned to your employees in your HRIS, this information will be automatically imported to your TripActions user list for each of your users. Please note that if you make manual adjustments to a user's office in the TripActions user list, these changes will be overridden by your HRIS sync if there is a discrepancy between the information you have entered in TripActions and what is listed in your HRIS.\n \nFor TripActions Liquid Customers \nThe legal entities you have configured in TripActions will determine the issuing currency of your employee's cards (virtual, physical, and purchase). The currency for each of your legal entities can be viewed by navigating to Travel | Book > Liquid | Admin > Company > Settings and clicking on the Legal entities tab.

    "body": "Using the Invite Guest tool\nThe Invite Guest tool allows those who book travel for others to invite company guests, such as interview candidates or clients, to book their own travel in TripActions while following the company's travel policies. This minimizes the back and forth necessary to book travel for non-employees and provides a better overall experience for both travel arrangers and guests. To find out how you can begin leveraging the Invite Guest tool, read below. \n \n\nInvite Guest Tool Access\nBefore you can invite guests to book travel, you will want to ensure that your TripActions program admin has given you the correct permissions to access the Invite Guest tool. Once you have the proper permissions, you can send an invite to a guest in the five easy steps outlined below. \n \n\nSending an Invite \nSTEP 1: Navigate to the Guest Invites page by clicking Travel | Book > Travel | Guest. Select Invite guest to create a new invite. \n\nGuest information\nOn the following page, you will be asked to fill in the guest's First name, Last name, Email, and any custom fields required by your company (such as Cost center or Department). You can also upload this information in bulk for multiple guests by clicking the Upload info tab, which allows you to upload a CSV file of guest information.\n\nPoint of contact\nYou will then want to ensure that you select the appropriate Point of contact for the guest; this will default to the invite creator but can be changed to any individual enabled within your company's TripActions user list. The point of contact will receive a copy of the guest's booking confirmation, as well as review and take action on any out-of-policy bookings (unless an override booking approver has been selected under your company's Guest Policy). \n\nExtra guests\nFor information on the Extra guest section of the invite, please see the Plus Ones section of this article. \n\nScreen Shot 2021-06-24 at 1.03.20 PM.png\n\nSTEP 2: Enter the details for the guest's trip, as shown below. \n\nEvent name/purpose: This will be the name on the trip invitation that is visible to the guest \nWhere: The guest's destination\nDate range: The range within which guests can book their travel. Set these dates according to the level of booking flexibility you would like to provide; a separate date range can be set for hotel accommodations. \nScreen Shot 2021-06-24 at 12.45.09 PM.png\n\nSTEP 3: Set the traveler's booking policy. You can select an existing policy already configured by your company for guest travel or set a new custom policy, specific to your invite/guest. If you are unsure what each policy in the dropdown menu entails, contact your company admin.\n\nTips: \n\nGuests are only allowed to book the items that are “checked\" in the screenshot below (i.e. If Car is not selected, then the guest will not be able to book a rental car for their trip). \nInvite creators can recommend airports for the guest to fly into, or suggest hotels for the guest to stay in. You may also leave notes for the guest in case there is a preferred arrival time or any other information you want them to see during the booking process. \nScreen Shot 2021-06-24 at 12.51.59 PM.png\n\nSTEP 4: Select a payment method and preferred hotel rate types, and fill out custom fields. \n\nPayment method\nYou will have the option of having the guest to pay with their personal card or a company credit card (applicable when your company admin has made one available for guest bookings). Selecting a company card will eliminate the need for the guest to be reimbursed later. If a rental car will be included in your guest's booking, you will also have the option of allowing them to pay by using any direct billing account configured for your company. Note: Guests are not able to see any card or direct billing account details.\n\nHotel room rate types \nIf your guest needs to book a hotel room, you will have the ability to restrict the room rate types available in their search results. The following options are available: \n\nPay now only: Guests will only be able to book rooms that are prepaid upon checkout in TripActions. Note: The guest will still be required to present a card for incidentals upon check-in at the hotel. \nPay at hotel only if corporate discount: Guests will only be able to book rooms where payment is provided upon check-in at the hotel, but only when the inviter's company has a corporate rate with the hotel property. \nPay now + pay at hotel only if corporate discount: Guests can book either of the two rate types previously listed \nAll: Guests can book any available rate type\n\nCustom fields\nIf your company has configured custom checkout fields (often used for internal reporting or cost allocation) they will be available for you to complete on the guest invite. Typically, custom checkout fields are completed by the traveler upon booking; however, for guest bookings, they will need to be completed by the event creator. Note: Custom checkout fields are defined at the company level by an account admin; you will not be able to modify the required fields in the guest invite. \n\nScreen Shot 2021-06-25 at 4.28.49 PM.png\n\nSTEP 5: Review the invite and select your send method. You can choose from Only generate the invite link if you would like to share the link with the guest yourself or Send emails to all guests to immediately email the link to the guest(s). \n\nScreen Shot 2021-06-24 at 12.49.58 PM.png\n \nPlus Ones\nThere may be instances to utilize the Invite Guest tool to invite employees (non-guests) to book travel for a specific event. In this case, you will be able to permit a plus one for your invitee by selecting Allow guest to book for one extra person during step one of the invite process. Invitees who are permitted a plus one will be able to add this individual to their booking by following these steps.\n\nConsiderations: \n\nA separate Trip Fee will be charged for the main invitee as well as for their plus one, for a total of two trip fees. \nPlus one functionality is only available for flights; if a hotel booking is needed, a shared room can be booked by the main invitee. Additionally, only one car rental can be booked. \nWhen a plus one is added to a guest invite, both travelers will be booked on the same Booking ID (regardless of whether the plus one is categorized as Business or Personal). The main invitee will receive booking confirmations for themselves as well as their plus one. \nIf you are looking to book travel for a group of employees at your company, we recommend that you utilize the TripActions Team Travel feature. \n \nGuest Experience\nFor a detailed overview of the guest's experience, see this article. \n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Will I be notified once a guest has made their booking?\nA: Yes, the person that created the invite and the person listed as the Point of contact (if applicable) will be copied on all booking confirmations. The person listed as the Point of Contact will also be copied on the invitation sent to the guest. \n\nQ: Where can I view all invitations sent to guests?\nA: You can manage all sent invitations by navigating to Travel | Book > Travel | Guest. This will show you a list of all existing invitations and allow you to send reminders, archive invitations, or make copies for future invitations. Additionally, you can click Download > Travel manifest to obtain a detailed report with guest traveler information including name, email address, flight departure/arrival time, hotel check-in/check-out dates, and more.\n\nQ: How do I edit an invitation? \nA: Navigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Guest. From there, locate the invitation you want to edit and use the pencil icon to manage. \n\nQ: Can guests make changes to their booking on the TripActions platform?\nA: Yes, bookings can be viewed, modified, and canceled directly from a user's Trips page. For instructions on how to change a booking, view this article. \n\nQ: What point of sale will my guest be on? \nA: Guests will be assigned to the same point of sale as the invite creator. For example, if the inviter is on the UK point of sale, the guest's TripActions page will be localized to the UK and prices will be listed in GBP. If, however, the guest already has an existing TripActions account and is using it to book guest travel, they will use the point of sale currently assigned to them. \n\nQ: Can a guest decline an invite in TripActions?\nA: Yes, guests are able to decline an invite through their email invitation or on their TripActions Invitations page. When a guest declines an invite, their status on the Guest Invites page will show as Declined, and event creators will be notified via email. ",

    "body": "Viewing and Managing Trip Proposals\nTrip proposals provide a simple way to control travel costs and give managers visibility into their team's travel prior to a booking being made by a traveler. Once a trip proposal is submitted, the traveler's manager (as indicated in TripActions) can review and subsequently approve or decline the proposed trip. \n \n\nNotification of a New Trip Proposal\nManagers are notified via email when a member of their team submits a trip proposal. The email will include pertinent details such as the names of the employee(s) requesting to travel, the reason for the trip, dates, location, and a cost estimate. Click Approve or Decline from the email to be directed to the Approvals tab of your Manager Dashboard. \n\nimage.png\nNote: If you are not receiving trip proposal notifications for your team, contact your company's account admin to ensure trip proposals have adequately been enabled and you have been assigned the correct manager permissions. \n\n\nViewing and Managing Trip Proposals\nNavigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Manager > Approvals > Trip Proposals\nUse the dropdown menu to view all pending, approved, or declined trip proposals\nUse the arrow next to each proposal for a simple overview of the request, or click Details to view detailed information about the proposed booking\nUse the red \"x\" or green checkmark to decline or approve the request\nimage.png\nWhen approving or declining a trip proposal, you will have the option to send a message to the traveler.

Additionally, any pending or approved trip proposals with booking dates in the past will expire and not be available to book. \n\n\nPolicy Considerations\nAfter a trip proposal is approved, the traveler's assigned policy rules will still apply; during the search process, the out-of-policy icon will display for all bookings that are not compliant with their assigned policy (such as exceeding the price maximum). If the traveler is making an out-of-policy booking, they will be asked to provide a reason on the checkout page.\n\nimage.png\nAll out-of-policy bookings will be sent to the traveler's designated approver (this may be different than the person receiving the trip proposal). The designated approver will receive an email notification of the out-of-policy booking and can take action on it through a link in the email or through their Manager Dashboard.

    "body": "An Overview of TripActions Rewards\nTripActions provides travelers the with best travel experience available on the market, while driving significant cost savings for employers. One of the most effective ways we have found to do this is by fundamentally changing employee spend behavior by incentivizing them to think more cost-consciously when booking business travel. To achieve this, we designed the TripActions Rewards program.\nWhat are rewards?\nTripActions Rewards is a points accrual program which encourages employees to treat company money more like their own. Traditional travel policies put a dollar cap on hotel rates, and travelers inevitably book as close to that cap as they can to ensure they get a nicer room. At TripActions, we introduced the Price to Beat (fair market price based on search results) concept, designed to incentivize travelers to save their company money by focusing on what a booking should reasonably cost, versus a blanket maximum that a traveler can spend. When travelers select a hotel below the Price to Beat, they are rewarded for it. This positive reinforcement further promotes better booking behavior. Travelers can redeem rewards for personal travel, business travel upgrades, or Amazon gift cards.\nHow do rewards save my company money?\nTripActions has a proprietary algorithm that calculates a median rate (or fair market price), which we call the Price to Beat. The result is a dynamic number that is calculated in real-time to determine the fair market value for every single booking. Rewards are calculated by the Price to Beat and the Savings Amount. Travelers who book rates that are cheaper than the Price to Beat earn TripActions Reward amounts in connection to their Savings Amount. The total price of the booking and the cost of rewards will always be lower than the total Price to Beat, therefore saving the employer money.\nRewards may be accumulated over time, or redeemed instantly once earned. Rewards will be in a pending status until the booking trip has been completed.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: How is my company charged for rewards?\nA: On the 3rd of each month, the TripActions finance team will email an itemized breakdown of rewards earned in the previous month. For detailed information about this process, view this article.\nQ: Who within my company receives the rewards invoice?\nA: Upon signing a contract with TripActions, a rewards payment method is determined as well as a designated person to receive the invoice. If you have questions or would like to have this changed, please contact your Customer Success Manager.\nQ: Why do rewards disappear when I click on Bill to Client?\nA: Rewards are automatically disabled when a traveler checks the Bill to Client box under the Advance filters on the search page. Rewards are a company-specific benefit, and any earned rewards would therefore not be paid by the company.\nQ: Am I able to cap the amount of a reward or change the accrual percentage for my company?\nA: No, this functionality is not currently available.\nQ: Can guests or travelers with a personal TripActions account earn rewards?\nA: No, guest invites, whether they are under your company or a TripActions personal account, are blocked from seeing rewards in their hotel and car search, and therefore blocked from earning them. Personal accounts are not eligible for rewards.\nQ: Are TripActions rewards considered a taxable benefit?\nA: Generally, yes. However, we cannot provide tax advice and recommend that you speak with your company's local tax advisor on this matter. Many TripActions customers throughout North America, Europe, and Asia view the rewards program as an employee benefit and tax it accordingly.\nIf you would like to turn on TripActions Rewards for your company, contact your Customer Success Manager for assistance.",

    "body": "Existing Credits or Bookings for Terminated Employees\nAutomated name changes (unused ticket transfer) on bookings for terminated employees are a great way to retain the value of a ticket that will no longer be used. For specific airlines, TripActions is able to provide automated name changes on unused tickets; continue reading to learn more. \n \n\nEligibility for Automated Name Changes on Unused Tickets (Flight Credits)\nThe rules around name changes on unused tickets vary greatly by airline, as well as the company's relationship with the airline where the flight credits are banked. Automated name changes via TripActions are currently available for: \n\nCompanies who have a current corporate discount agreement with United Airlines, Delta Airlines, Alaska Airlines, or American Airlines.\nCompanies enrolled in American Airlines Business Extra \nAny company with JetBlue credits \n \nHow Automated Name Changes Work\nFlight credits for users who have left the company and have been deactivated in TripActions, as well as flight credits for guests (travelers not on the company's user list who have been invited to book travel via Guest Invite or added to a trip as a guest) will go into a collective company pool of credits. These credits can then be used by other active travelers at the company who book future travel on airlines eligible for automated name changes. \n\nWhen future travel is booked on airlines eligible for automated name changes, travelers will receive a notification letting them know that company credits may be used for the booking instead of their selected payment method. This process is facilitated by TripActions Travel Experience Agents, who work to apply credits on the backend; if the application of a flight credit is successful, the credit will be reflected on the traveler's booking invoice. Otherwise, the payment method selected by the traveler upon checkout will be charged. Once a credit is used, the unused credit will be marked as Used on the TripActions Unused Credit Report.\n\nNote: This feature will need to be enabled for your company by TripActions; please contact your customer success manager to get started. \n\nimage.png\n \nHandling Active Bookings\nIf a terminated employee has an active booking in TripActions, bookings will remain active unless changed or canceled. To view all upcoming bookings, navigate to Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Reports > Bookings. You can search for bookings by traveler name or run a report to view all upcoming travel. Below are the options for how you can proceed with the active bookings:\n\nCancel the booking(s) and forfeit the cost\nCancel the booking(s) and request a refund directly from the vendor\n[For flights] Cancel the booking and request a credit(s) \nFor assistance with any of these options, contact the TripActions Travel Experience Team from your web or mobile app. \n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Can the automatic name change credit be used for mobile bookings?\nA: Automated name changes are currently only supported on web. \n\nQ: Can I transfer an individual’s unused credit from a personal trip?\nA: At this time we can only allow name changes on unused credits that were originally booked as a business trip with TripActions.\n\nQ: Can I transfer credits from one active employee to another active employee?\nA: A name change can only occur between an employee who is no longer active in TripActions and one who currently is.\n\nQ: What happens to flight credits for employees who are still active? Do they go into the collective company pool of credits if automated name changes are enabled? \nA: Credits who belong to employees that are still active in the TripActions user list will remain in their name and will not be added to the collective company pool of credits. The active user will be the only one who can use these credits for future business travel. ",

    "body": "TripActions Optimal Price and Median Price\nThe Optimal price and Median price, referred to as a fair market price, are numerical representations of the expected cost of a booking. Using dynamic pricing, TripActions technology aggregates all possible inventory based on your destination and travel dates to determine a fair market price.\n \n\nOptimal Price\nHotel Searches\nOn every hotel search, your travelers will see an amount to generate savings and an amount that is considered out-of-policy. When a traveler selects a booking below the amount to generate savings, they are saving the company money by spending below the expected cost of travel. If your company is enrolled in the TripActions Rewards Program, bookings made below this price may be eligible for rewards. Hotel search results on TripActions only include sensible options for business travelers; hostels and similar inventory or hotels with an average guest rating below 7 are excluded from the search results.\n\nimage.png\nimage.png\n \nNote: If your company has enrolled in TripActions Rewards, the amount to generate savings will be displayed as Earn rewards by booking below $xxx.  \n\n\nRental Car Searches\nOn every rental car search, your travelers will see the expected cost of travel in the form of a Price to Beat. When a traveler selects a booking below the price to beat, they are saving the company money by spending below the expected cost of travel. If your company is enrolled in the TripActions Rewards Program, bookings made below this price may be eligible for rewards. \n\nimage.png\n \nNote: If your company has enrolled in TripActions Rewards, the price to beat will be displayed as the Price to beat to earn Amazon rewards. \n \n\nMedian Price\nThe median price is available on all flight searches and shows the mathematical median price for each fare category (cabin class). This allows visibility into the cost of each fare option based on a traveler's desired route. The calculation only includes sensible fares for business travelers; extremely long flights, flights with an unnecessary number of stops, or flights priced much higher than others are excluded from the median price calculation and search results.\n\nimage.png\n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: How can I use fair market pricing as my travel spend policy?\nA: Under your Cost policies, set your Maximum Price to $0 to use dynamic pricing. TripActions will use the fair market price as a benchmark for which bookings are considered out-of-policy. \n\nQ: How does dynamic pricing work if I already have a Maximum Price set as my travel policy?\nA: The maximum price you set will be a top limit for any search. For example, if you set your policy to a maximum price of $300/night, and a traveler searches in New York where the fair market rate is $400, the rate displayed will be $300/night. If a traveler searches in San Antonio, where the fair market rate is $165, the rate displayed will be $165/night. Whichever number is lower will act as the traveler's policy. \n\nQ: Why is there no optimal price or median price listed for train searches? \nA: Train bookings do not have an optimal price or median price because train routes are often limited to one carrier, and pricing is exclusively determined by the provider.",

    "body": "The TripActions Dynamic Policy\nTripActions Dynamic Policy is a unique way to control your travel spend by providing your travelers with a benchmark for a fair price based on the market prices for their destination and travel dates. For any flight search, TripActions looks at all reasonable search results and then calculates a Median Price, or fair price, for the search. The same methodology is used for hotel and car searches; hotel searches will be labeled as the Optimal price, and car searches will be labeled as the Price to Beat. \n\nAs an example of the dynamic policy in action, let's think about booking travel to San Francisco; a city that is home to many large events, such as Salesforce's Dreamforce. These types of events tend to cause significant fluctuation in pricing for both flights and hotels. In the case that a static price cap is presented to travelers, many will adopt an \"I can spend up to...\" mindset. This means that in cases where the fair market price is lower than the price cap, many travelers will still choose to ignore the fair market price displayed to them and spend the full amount allotted to them by their company's policy since those bookings are technically policy compliant. Alternatively, if a dynamic policy is used, travelers will concentrate on the fair market price as their booking benchmark, and be far less likely to overspend. \n\n\nConfiguring Dynamic Policy in TripActions\nYou will have the option to leverage dynamic policy for your employee or guest travel policies for flights, hotels, and rental cars. To set a dynamic policy: \n\nNavigate to the Travel | Book > Travel | Admin > Policy > Travel policy or Guest policy\nSelect a policy category (i.e. Flights) and navigate to the Cost section \nChoose the group of users or individuals that you would like to add or change dynamic policy for, and click into the Policy column\nIn the Dynamic policy field, enter the percentage cap above the Median price/Optimal price that you would like to apply\nTripActions recommends setting a 20% cap and leaving the maximum price at $0. Leaving the maximum price at $0 allows the optimal price to be determined by the dynamic pricing model, and selecting a 20% cap indicates that only bookings that are 20% or more over the optimal price will be deemed as out-of-policy. \nIf you prefer to set a Max price per booking and would like more information about how price caps and dynamic pricing work together, view this article.",

    "body": "FAQ: TripActions Liquid™ physical cards\nQ: What is a TripActions Liquid physical card?\nA: TripActions Liquid physical cards work like a typical credit card and allow employees to make payments on the go.

See this article for more information. \n\nQ: Are physical cards available globally? \nA: TripActions Liquid physical cards are available for use in all global regions and can be used anywhere Visa is accepted. However, please note that cards can only be issued a company admin in USD, GBP, and EUR and transactions will settle in the card's issuing currency. Conversion fees will not apply. See this article for more information. \n\nQ: Where can cards be shipped? \nA: Cards issued in GBP or EUR can be shipped to the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and the United Kingdom.

    "body": "TripActions Liquid™ Virtual Card FAQ\nTripActions Liquid™ virtual cards are single-use credit cards used to purchase travel on the TripActions platform. Virtual cards provide companies with a streamlined reconciliation process while minimizing the risk for fraud. Continue reading for answers to frequently asked questions regarding TripActions Liquid virtual cards. \n\nQ: How do I give my employees access to virtual cards?\nA: Admins can provide their employees with access to virtual cards from the Admin Dashboard under Settings > Overview > Travel Payment Methods > + Add TripActions Liquid Card. Each new card added can be configured to be used by a specific department, cost center, region, or subsidiary. Additionally, admins will be able to define what types of bookings the card is available for (i.e. flights, hotels, cars, and/or trains) and whether it is available for use on guest bookings. \n\nQ: How long is a virtual card active? \nA: For flights, hotels, rental cars, and trains, virtual cards will deactivate seven days after a trip is completed. Virtual cards for black car bookings will remain active for thirty days after a trip, in order to allow sufficient time for the provider to complete the charge.\n\nQ: How do virtual cards work for pay-at-hotel bookings?\nA: Virtual Cards can be used for all hotel inventory types including pay-at-hotel bookings. Pay-at-hotel bookings will be paid through a Credit Card Authorization (CCA) form; this form will be automatically sent to the hotel and can also be accessed and resent by the traveler if needed. View this article for more information. \n\nQ: Can I set spend parameters on virtual cards? \nA: No; virtual card spend parameters are defined by your company's travel policies as configured on the TripActions platform. If out-of-policy bookings are made using a virtual card, they will be subject to the approval process selected under the user's assigned travel policy. Note: Your company's TripActions Liquid account does have a monthly spend limit, which you can view in the Liquid Dashboard under Company > Contact Info. \n\nQ: Can I create a virtual card for a specific department, region, cost center, or subsidiary? \nA: TripActions virtual cards are configured the same way as corporate credit cards; when adding a new TripActions Liquid virtual card, you have the ability to assign access by department, region, cost center, or subsidiary. Use the dropdown menus on the card creation page to choose All or select a specific group from each department, region, cost center, or subsidiary. \n\nQ: How can I exclude a specific department, region, cost center, or subsidiary from booking via virtual cards?\nA: The same as you would regular corporate cards; a specific department, region, cost center, or subsidiary can only be included, not excluded. For example, if your company has four departments and you want to exclude one, you will create a separate virtual card for each of the three remaining departments. \n\nQ: How is a virtual card protected against fraud? \nA: Each virtual card has a unique 16-digit number that is digitally-generated per transaction. Because each card is created for a specific transaction and not used anywhere else within the company, this provides a high level of protection in the event of a data breach. Virtual cards are also limited to the specific merchant category code (MCC) of the booking, so individuals with access to the card cannot use it beyond its intended purpose. A MCC is the credit card company's method of classifying businesses by type. Therefore, a hotel booking will be tied to a lodging MCC and will be declined on all purchases outside of lodging.",

A trip is created by making a booking for a hotel, flight, rental car, or train, with additional bookings added as needed.

For example, if you are visiting clients in Berlin and Munich, your trip in TripActions may include a roundtrip flight, your hotel stay in both cities, and a train ticket between cities. \n\nAdding Bookings to an Existing Trip:\n\nNavigate to the Trips section of your account and view your Upcoming trips\nClick on a trip and select + Add to Trip from the Trip Itinerary section\nYou will then be directed to the search page to make the additional booking, and only one fee will be charged for your trip.\nimage.png\n \nAdditionally, If you need to combine two or more bookings under a single trip, you can do so from the Trips section of your account by using the Merge Trips functionality.

Note: Train-only trip fees only apply to European train lines.\n\nAdding to an Existing Train-Only Trip:\n\nIf you create a train-only trip and later decide to add a flight, hotel, or car, the checkout page will display a trip fee that reflects the difference between your company's usual trip fee and the train-only trip fee that was previously charged. For example, if your company's standard trip fee is £20, a prorated trip fee of £15 will be charged for the additional booking. \nIf you create a train-only trip and later decide to add an additional train ticket within Europe, you will not be charged an additional trip fee.\n\nIMPORTANT NOTE: All trip fees are non-refundable fees charged for utilizing the TripActions platform and cannot be refunded even if a trip is canceled.\n \n\nTrip Fees for Guests \nAll guests added to a Team Invite or plus ones added through the Invite Guest feature will be charged a separate trip fee from the main invitee, for a total of two trip fees.

For example, If travel is allowed in Asia but travel in China is blocked, no bookings can be made in or out of China. However, travelers can book a flight within Asia, such as Japan to South Korea. \nIf a continent has all travel blocked but there is a country within the continent where travel is permitted, the more restrictive policy will go into effect. For example, if travel within Europe has been blocked and travel within Italy is permitted, a flight booking from Rome (Italy) to Milan (Italy) will be blocked.          \n\nTraveler Experience\nWhen searching for travel to a restricted location, travelers will see a default message alerting them that travel to this region is not allowed by their company. Additionally, any custom messaging (reason) will appear if it has been added to a specific restriction (see the previous section of this article). Travelers will be unable to proceed with making a booking to any location that has been restricted. \n \n\nScreen Shot 2022-02-25 at 5.10.00 PM.png\nNote: Flights with connections in restricted locations will display in search results, however, travelers will not be able to complete a booking that includes a restricted location.\n \n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nQ: Will TripActions ever restrict locations on my company's behalf?\nA: No, travel restrictions are only determined by your company. \n\nQ: If my company restricts a location, can a traveler connect with TripActions Support to make a booking to a restricted location?\nA: No, our support team will uphold any restrictions your company has implemented. If you need to make an exception for one traveler, you will need to temporarily remove the restriction while the booking is made. \n \nQ: If my company decides to restrict business travel to a certain location, will this also block personal travel to those areas?\nA: No, travel restrictions set by company admins are applicable to business travel only; personal travel bookings will not be restricted.

If you would like to assign the card to more than one department, cost center, region, or subsidiary, you can do so by adding the same card multiple times. For example, if you want to add one corporate card for travelers in the U.S. and in Canada, you will enter the card information twice: once for the U.S. region and again for the Canada region.\nWhat types of bookings can this card be used for?: Select the booking types that the card will be available for (flights, hotels, trains, rental cars, black cars).\nGuest bookings: Indicate whether the card should be available for guest bookings made through the Invite Guest feature.\nClick Save to save and close\nFrom the Travel payment methods section, specify the card's availability by booking type:\nPrioritized: The card will be the only available payment option for assigned travelers; travelers will not be able to use any other company payment method or a personal card. You cannot mark more than one payment method as prioritized.\nAvailable: The card will be listed as a payment option to assigned travelers; travelers can also select from other company payment methods marked as available or use a personal card.\nNot Available: The card will not be available as a payment option at checkout\nSelect Edit or Delete to manage saved cards\n \nRecommendations by Booking Type\nFlights: All flights are paid in full at checkout. If you would like all flight bookings and payments to flow through a central card, you should select prioritized. For recommendations on airline-issued UATP card permissions, see this article.\n\nHotels: Many hotels offer a Pay at hotel payment option, meaning a traveler can reserve the room but will be required to pay with a credit card upon arriving at the hotel. If you prefer that travelers prepay for their hotel bookings, they should always select hotel options marked as Prepay. Please note that travelers will still need to provide a credit card to cover the cost of incidentals.  \n\nTrains: All train tickets are paid in full at checkout. If you would like all train bookings and payments to flow through a central card, select prioritized. \n\nRental cars: Rental cars can be reserved on TripActions using a centralized payment method, however, rental car companies require that a physical card issued in the driver's name is presented at check-in. If you would like payments to flow through a centralized payment method, contact your Customer Success Manager to discuss direct billing. \n\nBlack cars: Black car bookings can be reserved using a centralized payment method and are charged by the vendor after the ride is completed. If you would like all black car bookings to flow through a central payment method, select prioritized.\n\nGuest invites: Company admins can specify which forms of payment they would like to make available for guest invites. The Invite Guest tool requires that the invite creator select one form of payment to be used for all of the guest's bookings. The event creator will choose from a dropdown list of payment methods marked as available for guest invites or allow the guest to use a personal card. We recommend that admins make one or more credit cards available so that guests do not have to use a personal card for bookings. Note: Guests are never able to see company payment information.\n\nTeam Travel: Payment for Team Travel bookings will default to the specific payment methods made available to each participant. For example, if you have made a specific credit card prioritized (required) for company travel, participants will only be able to use that card for their event bookings. ",

For instructions on how to configure a new access level, see this article.\n\nTraveler access (default): Traveler access allows for booking and managing your own travel and does not provide permissions to any company settings, administrative features, or reporting. \n\nFull admin access: Users with full admin access can manage all TripActions company settings and utilize all administrative features, including reporting, policy, company credit cards, user list, and approvals. It is recommended to limit the number of full access admins to a relatively small subset of individuals. \n\nPartial admin access: Partial admin access allows for the selection of access to only specific administrative features such as the Admin Dashboard and Analysis section, safety tools, reports, approvals, and the Invite Guest tool. Access can be granted to one or any combination of these features. Partial admin access is often used to extend permissions for HR and recruiting teams who will leverage our Invite Guest tool or key finance or operations stakeholders who need access to our duty of care tools or reporting functionality.\n\nManager Dashboard access: The TripActions Manager Dashboard is designed to give team managers, department heads, team travel event creators, and travel budget owners an at-a-glance view of relevant travel activity and data. Manager dashboard access can be configured in various ways, according to the type of role a user plays in your organization and the tasks they need to oversee; see this article for more information. \n\nDelegate access: Delegate access allows users to login as a colleague(s) in order to manage their profile as well as make and manage their bookings. This is a beneficial tool for assistants managing executive travel, or any other instance where users may not always book their own travel.\n\nInvite Guest tool access: The Invite Guest tool allows users to send travel invites to guests so they can make their own booking on the TripActions platform. This tool is often used by recruiters to book onsite interviews for candidates or by individuals responsible for booking company visitor travel. \n\nTeam Travel invite access: Team Travel invite access provides users with the ability to create team events and invite other TripActions users at their company to book group travel.

The second step is understanding what drives savings, and finally, identifying opportunities for improvement based on that data. \n\nOn the TripActions platform, 'Savings' represents the difference between the Total Estimated Spend and the Total (or Actual) Spend. TripActions' Estimated Spend is calculated based on the available inventory for the search parameters, including date and location. A simpler definition would be an estimated cost of what a traveler would have likely spent if they were not using TripActions. To ensure we are providing a fair Estimated Spend, we will not factor in options that do not make sense for business travelers (i.e. 1 star hotels or 2-stop flights when a single stop or nonstop flight option is available).\n\nSavings are achieved when a traveler books an option that is less expensive than the Estimated Spend figure (shown as Median Price for Flights, or Price to Beat for hotels and cars). Savings from discounted rates are also included. For instance, if the Price to Beat is $300 per night and a traveler selects a hotel for $225 per night, the savings amount would be the difference between the Estimated Spend (Price to Beat) and the actual price of $225, resulting in $75 of savings. To incentivize their travelers to book cost-consciously and further drive company savings, TripActions customers may also choose to enroll in TripActions Rewards; for more information on this program, see this article.

    "body": "Common Traveler Questions and Objections\nChange management is a natural part of the implementation process for any new tool. This article provides travel managers with suggested responses to questions and objections most commonly heard from travelers who are new to TripActions.\nTripActions is designed to optimize the corporate traveler experience; please note that the most common traveler objections are due to an initial unfamiliarity with the platform and offerings. We are here to support you in your implementation journey; reach out to your Customer Success Manager for additional change management assistance.\nCommon Flight Objections\nPrice comparisons: \"I can book this flight cheaper elsewhere\"\nMost often, we find that price discrepancies are related to travelers comparing Basic Economy fares outside of TripActions to standard Economy fares in TripActions. By default, TripActions does not surface Basic Economy inventory because it is not well-suited for the typical business traveler. Basic Economy flights appear less costly at a glance, but often charge extra for essential offerings a business traveler needs such as seat selection, or carry-on luggage. For more information on Basic Economy within the US, please see this article.\nTripActions sources inventory directly from airlines and will display the same, if not less expensive, pricing. Please contact your Customer Success Manager with any price discrepancies not related to Basic Economy, so that we can research and provide further insight. If possible, please provide detailed screenshots of what is displayed off-platform, and on the TripActions platform.\nCertain third-party booking sites may occasionally show a lower flight price, but often display pricing from a set of cached information that refreshes at checkout to the current, often higher, price. This means the traveler will initially see a lower priced flight, but the price will increase upon reaching the checkout page, and then will likely have price parity with TripActions.\nLow-cost carriers in the EMEA and APAC regions: These carriers often offer web-exclusive fares to entice travelers to book directly on their website. These fares are generally not shared with third party providers or travel management companies. Typically, TripActions pricing should closely match the airline's website but may not include exclusive fares that the airline does not offer outside of their own platform.\nAirline Imposed Fees in EMEA and APAC: Two of the world's leading inventory providers are the Global Distribution System (GDS) and Travelfusion. While we use this inventory in the U.S. as well as EMEA and APAC, there are often fees added to flights sourced from these inventory sources when shared outside of the U.S. Fees for this type of inventory are relatively low but you may notice that the fare doesn't exactly match the airline's website. TripActions is consistently taking steps to form direct partnerships with airlines so that we can offer complete price parity and enhanced access to amenities.\nAirline status and points: \"I can't earn my airline points\" or \"My status was not reflected\"\nAs long as a traveler has entered their loyalty number(s) correctly in their TripActions profile, their status will be reflected and they will be able to get their usual perks. For example, if a traveler typically gets free premium seat selection as part of their status with a specific airline, premium seats will be unlocked and available to book without an additional fee.\nTravelers will have the ability to continue earning rewards and loyalty points for their favorite airlines when booking in TripActions as long as their loyalty information is correctly entered in their TripActions profile. It is important to note that the name attached to the traveler's ticket should match the name associated with the loyalty program. If there is a name mismatch between the two, then the traveler's loyalty program will not be recognized and they will not earn their loyalty points. Any traveler can verify this information by logging into the airline's website directly to confirm how their name has been associated with the loyalty program.\nMissing TSA number: \"TSA PreCheck did not come through\"\nThe name entered in the traveler's TripActions profile must match their government-issued photo ID. If the name attached to their Known Traveler Number (KTN) does not match the traveler information in TripActions, then there will be a name mismatch and TSA PreCheck will not be printed on the ticket.\nTrip fees: \"I don’t have to pay trip fees when I pay directly with the airlines or third party sites\"\nTrip fees are paid for by the company, not the individual traveler, and provide unlimited access to the TripActions platform, exclusive negotiated rates, 24/7 support, and allows visibility to traveler whereabouts for safety purposes.\nIf you wish to hide the trip fee from your travelers and/or have them charged to a centralized payment method, see this article for more information.\nCommon Hotel Objections\nPrice comparisons: \"I can get better rates when I go directly to the hotel\"\nTripActions sources hotel rooms and pricing directly from the hotels themselves, so traveler should see full price parity. Discounted rates such as AAA, AARP, and military rates will also be displayed in TripActions. If there is a discrepancy, please ensure that the traveler is viewing the exact same room and cancellation type in both sources.\nSometimes you will find a traveler is seeing lower pricing on a hotel's website because they are using another company's corporate discount code; perhaps a customer or spouse has shared their company's discount code with them. Since those rates are not owned by your company, we are not legally able to upload them into our system for use.\nTripActions also passes along exclusive negotiated rates to all travelers. These rates are labeled with a \"TripActions Lodging Collection\" tag and are less expensive than what is available with the hotel directly.\nHotel loyalty points: \"TripActions won't allow me to earn my hotel points\" or \"My status was not applied when I checked-in\"\nTripActions is a marketplace with inventory sourced directly from hotels (i.e. Marriott and Hilton), and also from third-party consumer sites (i.e. Booking.com and Hotels.com). You may see similar rooms being sold by multiple providers. Only rooms fulfilled directly by the hotels will earn hotel loyalty points, which means status will only be taken into account when these direct rates are selected. This is typical of any business or consumer travel booking platform.\nEach room type will list whether or not it is loyalty point eligible. Travelers can also filter their results to only display options which are loyalty point eligible.\nAlthough hotel rooms booked in TripActions from third-party sites do not earn the traveler additional loyalty points, they tend to be the least expensive options and will offer the highest amount of savings for your company. The TripActions Rewards Program is designed to incentivize your travelers to choose these discounted rates to save your company more money. For more information on how TripActions Rewards can save your company money, see this article.\nPayment options: \"I booked this room on the company card and the hotel is telling me I need a form of payment\"\nThere are two types of hotel booking choices in TripActions: Prepaid and Pay at Hotel. Prepaid rooms allow the traveler to reserve and pay for a room in full at the time of booking. Pay at Hotel rooms are reserved upon checkout and paid for upon check-in at the hotel. A traveler may mistakingly select a Pay at Hotel room option assuming that the room will be paid for by the company card used to reserve the room. Instead, advise your travelers to select Prepaid rates which will allow them to place the full booking cost onto the company card at the time of booking. Once they check-in at the hotel, the traveler will only be required to present a card for incidentals.\nThe payment type is always visible to the traveler during search and checkout, and filters are available to streamline the booking process.\nIf a Pay at Hotel room has been selected but the traveler needs the booking to be prepaid to a company card, then you may request a credit card authorization form from the hotel. This will allow you to place the full cost of the booking onto a specified credit card.\nAdditional Resources\nTripActions customers will save a substantial amount of money by booking all company travel within a single platform; this overall savings should significantly outweigh the cost of few slightly more expensive bookings, should they occur. Additionally, our user-friendly platform drastically cuts down on booking time, freeing up your travelers time to focus on their work.\nWe look forward to helping you make your travel program successful!\n- TripActions Customer Success",
